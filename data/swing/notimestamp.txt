Aniket Awasthi: I personally think that this time we won't be able to create new jobs this time

Aniket Awasthi: What will happen in between
Arpit Saxena: Production will never dip, so lifestyles should only get better
Arpit Saxena: Distribution of wealth might be a concern
Aniket Awasthi: You see Trump winning!

Arpit Saxena: Universal basic income xd
Aniket Awasthi: That's the dream.
Aniket Awasthi: Some psychologist say that we'll have to occupy such unemployed people so that they remain pascified
Aniket Awasthi: Else they'll plan communist type revolution

+91 99209 22667: To be?
Aniket Awasthi: To get girls
Aniket Awasthi: Money and looks
Aniket Awasthi: Only 20 percent of girls care about intelligence.
+91 99209 22667: Aren't those the girls we should care about?
Aniket Awasthi: Do you really want to find intelligence in 'these'
+91 99209 22667: Yes. Though it won't be there.
Satya: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Even arpit won't try to find intelligence among these
Aniket Awasthi: Correct me arpit if I'm wrong
+91 99209 22667: I wouldn't try to find. But if it was there, it would be a plus.
Rohan Bhamre: Is there any Dan biz life simulator park anywhere
Rohan Bhamre: Would love to visit
Aniket Awasthi: It's called the five star brothel

Aniket Awasthi: @919920922667 do you agree?
+91 99209 22667: "a Class 4 textbook for environmental studies had suggested an experiment to the students to carry out an experiment that could lead to a kittens death"
+91 99209 22667: Rofl!!
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
+91 99209 22667: I wouldn't disagree :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Aniket Awasthi: I personally want AK 47 training from 10 year onwards
+91 99209 22667: Why aren't you the gun lover!
Aniket Awasthi: Satya wants no gun control
+91 99209 22667: Well, he would have probably plotted to blow our brains out in college if it weren't for gun control...
Aniket Awasthi: Who knows! He probably has desi katta with him already
Aniket Awasthi: Planning to keel Rupesh
+91 99209 22667: Haha
+91 99209 22667: Rather kill you
Aniket Awasthi: I'm his hamdard
Kartik Vermun: Happy Birthday Aniket :party_popper: :confetti_ball:

Aniket Awasthi: Just keep it after 18th June
Kartik Vermun: Anyone wants to go trekking
+91 99209 22667: For you and Rohan the mandate is clear
Kartik Vermun: What mandate?
+91 99209 22667: I want to chill, eat pizza and have beer
Aniket Awasthi: No trekking
Aniket Awasthi: We can take bikes or a car
+91 99209 22667: Car
+91 99209 22667: I n kartik know kno bikes
Aniket Awasthi: Arpit
Kartik Vermun: I can learn by then
Kartik Vermun: Takes one weekend and my willpower
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: It's way
Aniket Awasthi: Easy *
+91 99209 22667: I'm riding behind someone powered by experience
Aniket Awasthi: We'll rent bikes there but our major tour will be by car
+91 99209 22667: Where are we going again?
Aniket Awasthi: Leh. Any other suggestions?
+91 99209 22667: Darjeeling
Kartik Vermun: Goa
+91 99209 22667: Goa!!!!!
Aniket Awasthi: Goa in June?
Aniket Awasthi: It'll be raining
Kartik Vermun: Yeah bad idea
+91 99209 22667: Leh be expensive
Aniket Awasthi: Darjeeling se better hai leh
+91 99209 22667: 30K
Aniket Awasthi: Idk
Aniket Awasthi: We'll have to figure that out
+91 99209 22667: anurag, aditya went
+91 99209 22667: Utna laga tha
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: Goa can be done but it'll be raining
Aniket Awasthi: Road trip from Mumbai to Goa
Aniket Awasthi: Plus it'll be hot
Kartik Vermun: We can wait and go when Goa season starts
Aniket Awasthi: That's in December. Shubhayan won't be here
Kartik Vermun: Shubhayan when do you leave
Kartik Vermun: Season starts around September I guess
Aniket Awasthi: August
Aniket Awasthi: He leaves in August
Aniket Awasthi: Leh is a better plan
Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to trek
Rohan Bhamre: You fat fucks
Aniket Awasthi: Not enough time
Aniket Awasthi: Treks are long
+91 99209 22667: Le me trekking
+91 99209 22667: <Media omitted>
+91 99209 22667: You guys seriously plan something out. Totally depends on VISA date.
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Your loss
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/MavY_Z-LtR0
Rohan Bhamre: Arpit especially dekhna
Ambikesh Mishra: Has anyone else got this Shubham kedia guy personal messaging for money?
Aniket Awasthi: I got it
Aniket Awasthi: I blocked him
Ambikesh Mishra: I think I'll do the same
Ambikesh Mishra: He has money to go to Columbia but not enough to buy a ticket to Brazil. Like wtf
Aniket Awasthi: Scam
Ambikesh Mishra: Shubham got scammed :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Shubhayan
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tongue:
Kartik Vermun: Care to explain Shubhayan?
+91 99209 22667: Nah
Kartik Vermun: We all know you gave him money be
+91 99209 22667: Yep
Kartik Vermun: Atleast he messaged so in the mentorship group and expected rest to follow your foot step
+91 99209 22667: It's an individual choice. I let him know though that the group is not for sponsorship
Kartik Vermun: Abe you were suppose to kick him out
Kartik Vermun: That's how you let him know it's not for sponsorship
Aniket Awasthi: :thumbs_up:
Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea what this is
+91 99209 22667: And risk 4 mentees without a mentor? I know the guy means well.
+91 99209 22667: He's not gonna post it again
Kartik Vermun: Bcoz of that grp he got all what's app contacts and started spamming us personally
Kartik Vermun: Yeah well done Shubhayan
Rohan Bhamre: Ok it seems I live in a cave
Kartik Vermun: Slow claps :folded_hands:
Ambikesh Mishra: Dude that's how scamming happens. My Uber recently got hacked by russians
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking russians
Ambikesh Mishra: Someone took a limo ride in Moscow using my account
Kartik Vermun: :thinking_face:
Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking Trump donated him my contact probably
Kartik Vermun: Fuck man
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking drump
+91 99209 22667: I'll tell him to not spam you on WhatsApp. I'm not chucking him Outta the group
Kartik Vermun: You can get another mentor I'm pretty sure
Kartik Vermun: He even send me a mail on Gmail, did you share the emails with him as well?
+91 99209 22667: It's not that easy Kartik. I've put in my word to a lotta people in Chemical with few replies. If you can help, it would be great
Kartik Vermun: Chal chill
+91 99209 22667: Yes, the list is shared on the group after some mentors requested it
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm willing to help him but his plea doesn't make sense. He says he is going to Columbia for masters. That ticket is gonna cost money too. How's he getting that? Loan only pays for tuition and I'm highly doubtful any loan from India can pay for ivy league tuition fee. It all sounds a bit sketchy
Ambikesh Mishra: Not makes for a good.mentor imo
Kartik Vermun: I can see through the bullshit bro
Ambikesh Mishra: And personally spamming alums is highly weird
+91 99209 22667: If you guys don't wish to contribute that's perfectly fine. I'm not gonna say anything. I had a personal reason hence I helped.
+91 99209 22667: I'm not sure how much he's spamming. WhatsApp is a no-no. I've let him know that. One email may make sense, but multiple is not good.
+91 99209 22667: Night folks
Kartik Vermun: Dm me twice on whatsapp
+91 99209 22667: Such a noob....
Kartik Vermun: Yeah makes motives obvious
Kartik Vermun: Good plan though, will say that, who knows might have even worked
Rohan Bhamre: Or maybe he is astronomically desperate
Rohan Bhamre: Omfg guys I felt an earthquake
Ambikesh Mishra: How big was it?
Rohan Bhamre: If you see it in news later, know that you heard it here firsf
Rohan Bhamre: Omfg it was fucking scary
Rohan Bhamre: Epicenter must be far away though
Rohan Bhamre: I mean obviously
Rohan Bhamre: But yeag
Rohan Bhamre: Felt it fukcing intense
Ambikesh Mishra: Google tells one in j and k
Ambikesh Mishra: 4.5
Rohan Bhamre: It happened like a few minutes earlier
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah showing up now
Ambikesh Mishra: 4.8
Ambikesh Mishra: Very near delhi
Ambikesh Mishra: Extremely near epicenter
Kartik Vermun: @919425052635 how was the result?
Aniket Awasthi: Abhi exam hai June 18th ko
Aniket Awasthi: Last year to nahi hua tha
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy: the caption
Aniket Awasthi: He missed "the world" at the end

+91 99209 22667: :squinting_face_with_tongue: :squinting_face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Here's a weird thought. Have you guys ever wondered how similar Islamic terrorism is to DotA 2 feeding? The more people flame, the higher chances of players getting tilted and feeding. The more the west bombs in Asia, the more retaliation attacks it gets. If Volvo solved DotA 2 feeding it could lead to world peace
Aniket Awasthi: Now I can die in peace
Kartik Vermun: Ambikesh you should put this on reddit
Ambikesh Mishra: Would make a decent sociology thesis topic: human behaviour parallels in Jihadi self destructive ideology and "Peruvian stole mid, I'll go feed."
Aniket Awasthi: No. There are only two players in dota
Aniket Awasthi: Two teams
Aniket Awasthi: *
Aniket Awasthi: And the purpose is to let the team win. Hence support can be sacrificed. Geopolitics is al members for themselves, self interest triumphs.
Ambikesh Mishra: That makes sense. I don't see any promotion of self interest for people feeding.Though the irrational behavioural and highly toxic state of mind are similar. Plus everyone wants to play mid or core. DotA 2 exemplifies people's true darker side in the online world. Exaggerate it 10x in real life you get your terrorist. The emotions behind it seem uncannily similar.
Aniket Awasthi: Terrorists are feeding
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Waiting for rohan and arpit to comment
Ambikesh Mishra: US is the 5k player who took mid when a 2k ISIS who marked it first. Having no real power or skills it just decides to feed to make itself feel better
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw my Russian Uber hackera
Ambikesh Mishra: *hackers
Ambikesh Mishra: Thank fully got a refund
Aniket Awasthi: Bwhaha
Arpit Saxena: @18144419636 @919425052635 play PUBG please?
Aniket Awasthi: After 18th
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Rohan Bhamre: Holy fuck lol
Rohan Bhamre: Pubg
Rohan Bhamre: Do they even Kno that game
Aniket Awasthi: I Googled
Rohan Bhamre: Cuck game
Aniket Awasthi: Any esoteric joke regarding that game?
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: There I said it
Rohan Bhamre: And a comment regarding ambikesh's observation I'll release a statement later
Rohan Bhamre: Playing pubg now
Aniket Awasthi: Post a video
Aniket Awasthi: A clip
Ambikesh Mishra: Best of luck for the prelims Rohan and Aniket!
+91 99209 22667: \m/achana!
Kartik Vermun: Go fuck the world guys :thumbs_up:
Aniket Awasthi: Thanks
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket tells me Satya can me good arguments for religion
Rohan Bhamre: Prove your worth satya
Aniket Awasthi: Legion commander
Aniket Awasthi: Even i believe that religion is important for society
+91 99209 22667: Religion has some epic stories that inspired Asgardian gods
Kartik Vermun: Reminds me of AOM
Kartik Vermun: we should play sometime
Rohan Bhamre: How is it important
Rohan Bhamre: Humans can
Rohan Bhamre: And have formed communities without religion
Rohan Bhamre: And as robust
Rohan Bhamre: Religion gives no exclusive or an added protection to society
Rohan Bhamre: Or else intra religion altercations nahi hote
Rohan Bhamre: And please
+91 99209 22667: Not large ones.
Rohan Bhamre: Because religion is the largest part of our society today
Rohan Bhamre: And not because it gives strength to society
Rohan Bhamre: But because it was better propogated
Rohan Bhamre: Abe
Rohan Bhamre: It's too long to writr
Rohan Bhamre: We shud meet and discuss this
Rohan Bhamre: Way easier
+91 99209 22667: You can expect enthusiastic response for atheism or agnosticism on a large scale. There's nothing to get excited about
+91 99209 22667: The same way classical music suffers to Justin Bieber
Rohan Bhamre: Because people at large are fools
+91 99209 22667: Exactly
Rohan Bhamre: It's not good for society
Rohan Bhamre: A human society
Rohan Bhamre: Which strives for progress
Rohan Bhamre: Religion is regression
+91 99209 22667: Weren't you pro BJP?
Rohan Bhamre: Please......
Rohan Bhamre: Do not call me
Rohan Bhamre: That
Rohan Bhamre: For the love of God
+91 99209 22667: Bhakt!
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: Throw around the slurs
+91 99209 22667: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: :grimacing_face:
Rohan Bhamre: Wait
Rohan Bhamre: Hadn't I invited Satya
Rohan Bhamre: Not that I mind anyone else joining
+91 99209 22667: Well religion helps society as much as Justin Bieber and Katy Perry
Rohan Bhamre: Which is to keep large sections of population for actually developing a more sophisticated taste for music
Rohan Bhamre: *from
+91 99209 22667: The opium of the masses
+91 99209 22667: Religion in itself is not an issue
+91 99209 22667: People will believe in all sorts of things
+91 99209 22667: What is really the problem is when it becomes the one defining thing in relating to another man
Rohan Bhamre: That's inevitable
Rohan Bhamre: There always will be classification in human society
+91 99209 22667: Classification is fine as long as there is multi-classification
Rohan Bhamre: And yes I am bjp aligned
+91 99209 22667: So that people can possibly relate on multiple levels
+91 99209 22667: You are right-aligned :D
Rohan Bhamre: I really don't care for right left
Rohan Bhamre: It's too confusing
Rohan Bhamre: There's left in right and right in left
+91 99209 22667: Theirs testosterone in women and oxytocin in men
Rohan Bhamre: These terms are excruciatingly vague
+91 99209 22667: When you split them into socio vs economic it becomes clearer
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe
+91 99209 22667: I like Ayn Rand
Rohan Bhamre: Or rather
Rohan Bhamre: Just discuss specific ideas you believe in
+91 99209 22667: Hard right economically. Hard left socially.
+91 99209 22667: True
Rohan Bhamre: Well
Rohan Bhamre: She American russian
Rohan Bhamre: Lol
+91 99209 22667: Haha
Aniket Awasthi: Katy perry ko kuch mat kehena
Aniket Awasthi: First thing
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: I'm sure aniket
+91 99209 22667: I'm calling her a goddess. I'm sure she won't mind.
Rohan Bhamre: Your viewing pleasure would be increased tenfold if you mute her Miss c
Rohan Bhamre: *music
+91 99209 22667: Even God doesn't have a million Twitter followers
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: Religion has its use
Rohan Bhamre: Like keep the fools controlled with it
Rohan Bhamre: If you don't have the texh to uplift them
Rohan Bhamre: But when religion actually gains power in a state
Rohan Bhamre: That is foolish
Rohan Bhamre: Like theocracy
+91 99209 22667: Say that to Cersei Lannister
+91 99209 22667: She'll agree
+91 99209 22667: How is Yogi Adityanath doing?
Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea
Rohan Bhamre: Why would you ask me that
+91 99209 22667: Katy Perry has 100 million Twitter followers sorry!
+91 99209 22667: I meant as a CM
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket is typing something lengthy
Aniket Awasthi: Humans are clanish. They usually get along in a group of few hundreds in case of absence of any binding information. Religion provides that information to humans to expand the society. Hence this allows them to expand beyond a clan. Like if someone is a Muslim and you too are Muslim then you can presume a few things about each other. Hence this is a case of presumed information which is likely to be true. Hence you can enter into a deal with some trust. While in absence of any binding information we would be rendered into assuming other person as a pure rational with absence of information. In short religion helps us to beat the Nash equilibrium of the prisoners dilemma
Rohan Bhamre: Baaaam
Rohan Bhamre: Bhak
+91 99209 22667: Where both club each other because if one trusts the other the other may club him
Rohan Bhamre: Even language gives tgat
Aniket Awasthi: Kuch bhi
Rohan Bhamre: Even a common profession gives that
Aniket Awasthi: What assurance does language provide?
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me what assurance does the language provide?
+91 99209 22667: The ability to communicate our intentions
Aniket Awasthi: Assurance or information
Rohan Bhamre: Wait
Rohan Bhamre: Don't you live in india
Rohan Bhamre: How marathis behave with marathi
Rohan Bhamre: Vs non Marathi
Aniket Awasthi: Ya Al-uuuh
Rohan Bhamre: Similar with other cultures
Aniket Awasthi: I didn't say that.
Aniket Awasthi: Read what I've written
+91 99209 22667: So it provides a way to bond beyond language
Rohan Bhamre: The debate is too extensive
Aniket Awasthi: A Muslim from Indonesia will bond with a Saudi more readily than a philipino
Rohan Bhamre: We need to talk face to face
Aniket Awasthi: No
Rohan Bhamre: That's just classification
Aniket Awasthi: You talk random stuff like language. Confine it to religion
Aniket Awasthi: Goddess perry too
Rohan Bhamre: My point is that it's not an exclusive feature of religion
+91 99209 22667: He's saying that the work of religion can be accomplished by a number of other tools like language
Aniket Awasthi: You haven't understood what I meant
+91 99209 22667: So we can discard it
Rohan Bhamre: Any categorization in human society can do that
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: Listen
Aniket Awasthi: Just assume two people of the same language.
Aniket Awasthi: English.
Aniket Awasthi: Living in America and other in india
Aniket Awasthi: If both are Muslims then they can assume a few feature about each other. Like one would not eat pork
+91 99209 22667: That saves the world
Aniket Awasthi: This information is very important to think beyond the clan
Aniket Awasthi: It's about safe assumptions
Rohan Bhamre: And what if religion didn't exist
Aniket Awasthi: Else humans are very apprehensive about each other especially who are beyond the clan
Rohan Bhamre: What is the loss
Aniket Awasthi: Clanish behavior
Aniket Awasthi: You won't get a few information about a stranger
Rohan Bhamre: "religion provides another layer of classification"
+91 99209 22667: But with Facebook and Google Translate Abhi religion ki kya zarurat?
Rohan Bhamre: Basically this right
Aniket Awasthi: Added layer
Rohan Bhamre: How is that
Aniket Awasthi: We aren't talking about language
Rohan Bhamre: A unique feature
Aniket Awasthi: Speaking a same language doesn't provide any information about the person
Rohan Bhamre: Any means of categorization does that
Rohan Bhamre: IT DOES
Aniket Awasthi: It just eases the means of communication
Aniket Awasthi: It doesn't
Rohan Bhamre: Omfg dudr
Rohan Bhamre: Culture is most tied to language
Aniket Awasthi: What can I assume about a marathi
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Aniket Awasthi: Or what can two marathi assume about each other
Rohan Bhamre: So much
+91 99209 22667: That he has terrible taste in food
Rohan Bhamre: My god
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: I think this problem is cuz you lived in mp
Aniket Awasthi: Discuss ad rem
Rohan Bhamre: Ok I'll talk about mhs
+91 99209 22667: What can two Indoris assume? Good taste in food!
Rohan Bhamre: Marathis mostly do clerical jobs
+91 99209 22667: What can an Indori and a Bengali assume. Good taste in food.
Rohan Bhamre: They celebrate certain fests
+91 99209 22667: Really?
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
+91 99209 22667: Everybody does
Rohan Bhamre: I'm mhs
Rohan Bhamre: You find so few biz men
+91 99209 22667: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: Most biz are guj or Marv here
Aniket Awasthi: I am not talking about the difference. I was talking about the information that it conveys
+91 99209 22667: True among bongs too
+91 99209 22667: But yeah the info matters
+91 99209 22667: Even no pork eating is meh
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Holy shit
Aniket Awasthi: Firstly. The clerical job etc are related to castes and not language
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Marathi speaking sindis will indulge in business
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Sindhi are people who migrated from sindh.
Aniket Awasthi: After partition
Aniket Awasthi: They mostly indulge in business.
Aniket Awasthi: Even though they speak marathi because they live there
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Ye culture kahan se aaya!
Aniket Awasthi: We were talking about language
Aniket Awasthi: Talk about it
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: I speak English
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan is partly English
Aniket Awasthi: I commend myself on this line.
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: It's malwi culture
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow you should now concede that language is not a very important means of conveyed information. Yes culture is
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Ok America is a vast land which speaks English
Aniket Awasthi: There are cultural differences
Aniket Awasthi: South America speak mostly Spanish
Rohan Bhamre: So?
Aniket Awasthi: Yet so many cultural divisions
Aniket Awasthi: Culture and language aren't the same.
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. You mean culture and not language
Aniket Awasthi: You must be grilled for this gaff
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Secondly. Culture does provide enough information. Religion is an added layer
Aniket Awasthi: Cultures of the two regions can't be the same
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse that's the whole point. You proved my point.
Aniket Awasthi: Bhack bc.
Aniket Awasthi: A Muslim from Indonesia and Muslim from turkey can assume a few things
Aniket Awasthi: Which the culture doesn't provide
Aniket Awasthi: Because the culture can't
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: That's the case of true knowledge of culture
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know about Vietnamese culture
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Rohan Bhamre: No
Aniket Awasthi: But you do know about Christianity
Aniket Awasthi: Islam
Aniket Awasthi: Hindus
Aniket Awasthi: Bhuddism
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Hence if you meet a Vietnamese Muslim then you do have information about Muslim aspect
Aniket Awasthi: But not the Vietnamese aspect
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Aniket Awasthi: If you forgo the religion.
Aniket Awasthi: You essentially have only one presumed information
Aniket Awasthi: That is the culture
Aniket Awasthi: And people don't know cultures easily because there are too many cultures
Aniket Awasthi: I never said that culture is not important
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: I said that religion is something that can expand throughout cultures
Aniket Awasthi: Hence an added information about each other
Rohan Bhamre: Really not relevant in today's times
Aniket Awasthi: Why?
Rohan Bhamre: ...
Rohan Bhamre: What information deficit I have
Rohan Bhamre: *will
Aniket Awasthi: I don't get you
Rohan Bhamre: Why are you sticking to this point about religion
Rohan Bhamre: Where it behaves exactly like any other method of classification in human society
Rohan Bhamre: And pretending that added layer of info is good enough pro
Rohan Bhamre: To talk about
Rohan Bhamre: That it's worth keeping human society centuries behind in terms of progress
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me another way to replace that information that you get from religion
Rohan Bhamre: Don't replace
Aniket Awasthi: Afreeka had no religion before Islam
Aniket Awasthi: Probably it was your true society
Rohan Bhamre: They had
Aniket Awasthi: I mean a unifying religion
Aniket Awasthi: I correct myself
Rohan Bhamre: Please
Rohan Bhamre: They had religion and zero tech
Rohan Bhamre: Bar that Ethiopian empire
Rohan Bhamre: Which also soon fell
Rohan Bhamre: Because they lagged behind in social and military tech
Rohan Bhamre: That's it
Rohan Bhamre: They were extremely conservative people
Rohan Bhamre: Stigma
Rohan Bhamre: Blind Faith rampant
Aniket Awasthi: You're proving my point
Aniket Awasthi: Humans are superstitious
Rohan Bhamre: You can very well argue religion held them back
Rohan Bhamre: Muslims were more progressive
Aniket Awasthi: There are many superstitions beyond religion too
Rohan Bhamre: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: And I condemn them just like religion
Aniket Awasthi: Nothing particular to religion
Aniket Awasthi: The pro and cons analysis
Aniket Awasthi: Religion has more pros
Aniket Awasthi: Else people will keep clan fights alive
Rohan Bhamre: You just listed it's categorical ability
Aniket Awasthi: Religion is the only thing that binds Saudi today
Rohan Bhamre: Not true
Aniket Awasthi: There are 5 tribes there
Aniket Awasthi: They still fight
Rohan Bhamre: Culture is what tore the muslim caliphate apart
Rohan Bhamre: Where are the strong religious bindings
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse
Rohan Bhamre: Today the world is politically organized in terms of culture
Aniket Awasthi: Just imagine things without religion
Aniket Awasthi: Tell this to ummah
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Lel
Aniket Awasthi: Tu sun hi nahi raha hai
Aniket Awasthi: I am accepting your points when they are true
Rohan Bhamre: What am I not listening
Rohan Bhamre: Ok I apologise if it seems so
Aniket Awasthi: But your harder stance is very staunch
Aniket Awasthi: I am not talking about culture at all
Aniket Awasthi: All things regarding culture is true
Rohan Bhamre: Even I'm not talking about culture
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: I am just saying that region is another peice of information that encompasses various culture
Aniket Awasthi: There's no other social technology to provide us with that
Aniket Awasthi: Till now
Rohan Bhamre: Muslim rulers have ruled Hindu populations

Rohan Bhamre: Guys do you really think Russia did all the fancy hacking in us elections

Kartik Vermun: Speaking of Russians
Ambikesh Mishra: I dunno. I don't follow American politics much.
Ambikesh Mishra: They are freaked out by n.korea testing ICBMs
Ambikesh Mishra: One thing I do know having a lot of Iranian friends is that US's agenda vs Iran is total bs
Rohan Bhamre: Us and saudi
Rohan Bhamre: They are bullying the truth
Ambikesh Mishra: + interesting stuff going on with China
Ambikesh Mishra: The world would save so much money and spend it on important things like poverty, education and healthcare if only it didn't had to spend it on nuclear weapons and military
Ambikesh Mishra: I think 400 years from now humanity has no future if it doesn't unite under 1 umbrella
Ambikesh Mishra: 1 human civilzation: the idea of nation's has to become obsolete
Ambikesh Mishra: I would love to study how long the earths resources gonna last
Ambikesh Mishra: Pretty sure the next big world war is going to be on oil/fuel
+91 99209 22667: We'll have moved on to renewables long before
Ambikesh Mishra: There will be a big war though.
Ambikesh Mishra: History tells you that
Ambikesh Mishra: Large portion of the world is won't have
+91 99209 22667: History main nuclear weapons nahi they
Ambikesh Mishra: It takes just one trigger for everyone to start using them
Ambikesh Mishra: It's inevitable
+91 99209 22667: Koi nhi
Ambikesh Mishra: N. korea or someone uses it
Ambikesh Mishra: Then it's fair game.for everyone
+91 99209 22667: Nobody's gonna singe their ass for North Korea
Ambikesh Mishra: Pretty sure n Korea will be used as a puppet for a bigger power struggle between China us
Ambikesh Mishra: Expansionist policies eventually will lead to war

Ambikesh Mishra: I heard lot of crime on the subway
Ambikesh Mishra: there
Rohan Bhamre: Humans are too racist to have a one umbrella government
+91 99209 22667: The place found me
Rohan Bhamre: 99 percent of nation's today are based on culture
Ambikesh Mishra: Well then humanity is doomed to perish like the dinosaurs
Rohan Bhamre: No
Rohan Bhamre: You are exaggerating astronomically
Ambikesh Mishra: It will destroy itself
Ambikesh Mishra: Fighting over Petty squabbles or limited resources
Ambikesh Mishra: Or.when the earth can't sustain it anymore
Rohan Bhamre: You have been influenced by post apocalyptic stories
Ambikesh Mishra: Timeftame. I dunno
Ambikesh Mishra: Everhthing has a death daye
Rohan Bhamre: You are just talking abstracts
Ambikesh Mishra: How is extinction abstract?
Rohan Bhamre: The way you are implying extinction is abstract
Ambikesh Mishra: Name the no species that started 1st day when earth could support life that exist today
Rohan Bhamre: Name one sentient species we have encountered
Ambikesh Mishra: How are fight over culture, race not self destruct I've?
Ambikesh Mishra: 0
Rohan Bhamre: There will be fights
Rohan Bhamre: Everything has a d day
Rohan Bhamre: That
+91 99209 22667: We have Elon Musk
Rohan Bhamre: Is abstract
Ambikesh Mishra: Exactly
Ambikesh Mishra: How is it abstract? It's a fact
Rohan Bhamre: Please
Rohan Bhamre: It's theological and philosophical
Ambikesh Mishra: That human race will be extinct?
Rohan Bhamre: "everything has a d day"
Ambikesh Mishra: I bet one T trx said it to another too: he bro extinction is just theory
Ambikesh Mishra: T Rex
Rohan Bhamre: We aren't discussing extinction
Rohan Bhamre: We are discussing extinction due to human conflict in near future
Rohan Bhamre: There is a case which this can occur
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah that is just theory. Maybe that conflict just results in population reduction
Ambikesh Mishra: Extinction will probably take millennials to fully occu
Rohan Bhamre: But for that to occur specific events need to happen in a designate manner
Ambikesh Mishra: I only.conjecture that it will be a major contributing factor
Ambikesh Mishra: Which isn't far fetched at all
Satya: Water
Rohan Bhamre: Conflicts will happen
Rohan Bhamre: I'm just saying these conflicts leading to extinction is an eccentric statement
Ambikesh Mishra: No it's just a contributing factor. But a major one nonetheless
Ambikesh Mishra: A united race stands a chance against nature but one with internal discord.doesent
Ambikesh Mishra: That's not eccentric at all in my view
Ambikesh Mishra: We should right now be focusing on havens outside of earth
Rohan Bhamre: Given the tech that we have
Rohan Bhamre: Aren't we
Rohan Bhamre: Tech aage to jaane de
Ambikesh Mishra: No we arent. Space research is so under funded these days
Rohan Bhamre: Abe
Rohan Bhamre: Dude
Ambikesh Mishra: Tech goes ahead when people invest in it
Rohan Bhamre: Of course one world government sounds good
Rohan Bhamre: Won't work
+91 99209 22667: More reasonable
Rohan Bhamre: Talk in real terms
Rohan Bhamre: Civil wars internal conflict hote rahenge
Rohan Bhamre: Current world order is probably the best we have possibly have
+91 99209 22667: Funding is a bitch, can't rely on it. Private sector main hoga now :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
Rohan Bhamre: No doubt we should still strive for a better global society
Ambikesh Mishra: Democracy was an outlandish notion 2000 years ago present in 1 or 2 countries
Rohan Bhamre: Not really
Ambikesh Mishra: That simply isn't true
Rohan Bhamre: Those nation's went on to be world powers of that time
Rohan Bhamre: It's a noble idea
Rohan Bhamre: And in future even I hope it to be truw
+91 99209 22667: Kings in Saudi? Putin in Russia? Chinese Communism? Trump?
Ambikesh Mishra: It's probably utopian
Ambikesh Mishra: One world one government
Ambikesh Mishra: But utopian ideas eventually lead.to pragmatic toned.down solutions
Rohan Bhamre: Even Rome and Greece had currotion and nepotism
Rohan Bhamre: Even Rome and Greece had currotion and nepotism
Ambikesh Mishra: No world will ever be perfect. But that isn't an excuse to accept the current system
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not accepting
+91 99209 22667: And got conquered by barbarians
Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying
Ambikesh Mishra: It's well proven fact inter culture collaboration is more.productibe than isolated same culture.ideology
Ambikesh Mishra: That's why all major companies whose sole purpose is effecincy at making money adopt that model
Rohan Bhamre: We HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COLLABORATINV
Ambikesh Mishra: It's more than just a hypothetical utopian pipe dream
Ambikesh Mishra: Trump is hardly that..China India conflict is hardly collaboration
Rohan Bhamre: One bloody conflict
Rohan Bhamre: And so many collaborations that is holding the world
Ambikesh Mishra: That I agree with you!
Ambikesh Mishra: That's why the current trends are concerning
Ambikesh Mishra: Trump, brexit
Ambikesh Mishra: Escalation of military skirmishes
Ambikesh Mishra: All these are adding up
Ambikesh Mishra: Something big is gonna happen
Ambikesh Mishra: Or maybe I'm just a doomsday merchant
Ambikesh Mishra: But I'm pretty sure that is not a crazy thought right now
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: True
Ambikesh Mishra: Seconded
Aniket Awasthi: Ambi talks like Malthus
Aniket Awasthi: "The decline of human civilisation due to resources"
Aniket Awasthi: The world would become more intertwined gradually.

Aniket Awasthi: Out of our league
Rohan Bhamre: He is a simple man
Rohan Bhamre: Literally
Rohan Bhamre: He sees boob he says damn
Ambikesh Mishra: Nothing is out of league! You just need charisma and luck. The former I will never have :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: Why not?
Rohan Bhamre: NVM I know
Ambikesh Mishra: Enlighten me!
Kartik Vermun: @18144419636 we are going to have a discussion soon
Ambikesh Mishra: Can change my life
Ambikesh Mishra: Topic?
Rohan Bhamre: Boobs!
Aniket Awasthi: You need moneys
Aniket Awasthi: And power
Aniket Awasthi: To get pussy
Aniket Awasthi: Baba Dan bizlerian se seekho
Ambikesh Mishra: I doubt Bill Gates would ever get much pussy
Ambikesh Mishra: With just power and money
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse the intent
Rohan Bhamre: Probably he doesn't want pussy
Ambikesh Mishra: Tinder here is.kind of fun. You get matched with hot girls but I got no game
Ambikesh Mishra: Its so pathetic
Ambikesh Mishra: I need lessons on charisma and people skills
Rohan Bhamre: Are madarchoso
Ambikesh Mishra: Much needes
Aniket Awasthi: Put up a few pompous photos
Aniket Awasthi: You'll get pussy
Aniket Awasthi: Some real expensive shit
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah take lessons from Aniket
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you think people with sports car get a lot of pussy attention
Rohan Bhamre: He is the biggest playa here
Aniket Awasthi: Andho me kaana raja

Rohan Bhamre: But you can take lessons from me too
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah big picture fundae
Rohan Bhamre: I think this is a no brainier
Ambikesh Mishra: What do people fundamentally do wrong?
Rohan Bhamre: But you need to make her laugh
Rohan Bhamre: And it's really difficult
Rohan Bhamre: Don't listen to Aniket much ok
Aniket Awasthi: Savage he is
Rohan Bhamre: He has very pessimistic views on girls
Aniket Awasthi: Maybe
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm in the same category
Ambikesh Mishra: I wish getting pussy was easier and not so.much hard work
Aniket Awasthi: Firstly. You are obviously looking out for a girl who is above your league
Aniket Awasthi: Who is hot. Hot girls get a lot of attention
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes otherwise it's no fun at all
Aniket Awasthi: In case of non hot girls you can get her by being a good human
Aniket Awasthi: But since a hot girl gets a lot of attention. You need to get her attention
Aniket Awasthi: The first rule is aesthetics. You need to have a good body. Shouldn't be a panda
Aniket Awasthi: The second rule is that you need something that she finds respectful. That can be money or power or the job
Ambikesh Mishra: Being good and nice is likea non refundable ticket.to friend zone
Ambikesh Mishra: The others make sense
Aniket Awasthi: Good human bole to a normal human
Ambikesh Mishra: Still just conversing is an art that I was much better at when I was 18
Aniket Awasthi: Non hot girls don't get much attention. They like such attention
Ambikesh Mishra: Kgp had stunted my abilities
Aniket Awasthi: You've become more intellectual.
Aniket Awasthi: Don't be intellectual with normal people
Aniket Awasthi: See the crowd.
Rohan Bhamre: Fuxj
Ambikesh Mishra: Ah that's enlightening
Ambikesh Mishra: But I can't read messages like this anyome

Aniket Awasthi: Be pompous
Rohan Bhamre: Teach yourself to enjoy these
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm learning skate boarding these days
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
Rohan Bhamre: Be a pro
Aniket Awasthi: You need to behave like "I get too much attention. I don't need your attention"
Rohan Bhamre: Works Everytime!
Aniket Awasthi: Be very pompous. You need to show what you have
Aniket Awasthi: All expensive and fancy stuff. But in a subtle manner
Aniket Awasthi: Like put up a photo with a big ass architecture project
Rohan Bhamre: And operate your face maybe :grimacing_face:
Aniket Awasthi: My face is bad. That's a disadvantage
+91 99209 22667: It's not about the face
Ambikesh Mishra: Mine too. I have monkey eyebrow s
+91 99209 22667: It's what you make of it

Aniket Awasthi: Nahi be
Rohan Bhamre: No comments
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't know him
Ambikesh Mishra: Just heard from.people
Aniket Awasthi: BRB
Rohan Bhamre: It's funny really
Rohan Bhamre: Girls are supposed to be more picky
Rohan Bhamre: You just need good circumstances
Rohan Bhamre: Make a girl feel 'special'
Rohan Bhamre: And she will like you
Rohan Bhamre: Many girls are like this
Rohan Bhamre: In india
Rohan Bhamre: I'm hoping elsewhere it is different
Ambikesh Mishra: It's the same here
Rohan Bhamre: I can prove this to you
Rohan Bhamre: Many girls will have apparently unimpressive boyfriends
Rohan Bhamre: *impressive girls will have unimpressive bfs
Ambikesh Mishra: The ones who have had a lot of boyfriend's are the interesting ones
Rohan Bhamre: But very few impressive boys will have unimpressive gfs
Rohan Bhamre: That's a testemant to the fact girls aren't picky like boys
Ambikesh Mishra: I guess it's a matter of comfort zone and laziness..the guy who makes the most effort
Ambikesh Mishra: Allows.girls to be the laziest
Ambikesh Mishra: Since girls hardly ever take the initiative
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways some nice fundae.
Ambikesh Mishra: I'll try them
Ambikesh Mishra: Time to sleep for office!
Rohan Bhamre: Picky about personality traits
Rohan Bhamre: They are picky about efforts
Ambikesh Mishra: Honestly I'll gladly just marry the next Indian girl who dosent type lyk dis
Rohan Bhamre: You elitist asshole
Aniket Awasthi: Slave morality
Aniket Awasthi: Just shed the slave morality
+91 99209 22667: What's that?
Rohan Bhamre: Who
Aniket Awasthi: http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html
Aniket Awasthi: It's a good way to live too.
+91 99209 22667: Slave morality?
Aniket Awasthi: No. Master morality
Aniket Awasthi: In essence. Hot girls get too much attention. They won't get with someone who chases her. She will want someone who she would have chased.
+91 99209 22667: Aye
Aniket Awasthi: So you need to play on being that kind of a man that the hot girl would chase
Aniket Awasthi: So you need Arth dharma kam
Aniket Awasthi: Money. Ethics. Things that you desire
+91 99209 22667: Things that I desire??
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/IPVMBg9Cxpg

Kartik Vermun: seeing the protagonist reminded me of Rohan
Rohan Bhamre: Ambikesh bhadwe
Rohan Bhamre: Get ready to be bamboozled for your 's world government, global homogeniety' idea
Rohan Bhamre: Before uttering this idealistic nonsense
Rohan Bhamre: Have you ever thought why there are nations
Rohan Bhamre: The very reason for the existence of political entities
Rohan Bhamre: It's not because, a certain people are of a certain culture, history, religion etc etc
Rohan Bhamre: Not really
Rohan Bhamre: The existence of unity and cooperation in a state is
Rohan Bhamre: The threat outside of that state
Rohan Bhamre: Indians are United because we have external threats
Rohan Bhamre: Any other nation for that matter
Rohan Bhamre: Global society won't be achieved by cultural technology
Rohan Bhamre: It will be achieved by an immediate danger outside the world
Rohan Bhamre: Namely 'hostile aliens'
Rohan Bhamre: Humans unite against a common threat
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not saying global Co operation and peace is not humane and not possible
Rohan Bhamre: Rehne de this is getting too long . Milne k baad bolte h
Rohan Bhamre: In a administrative structure that is
Rohan Bhamre: An
+91 99209 22667: Socha hainnnnn.... Ye tumne kya kabhi? Aasma hain Nila kyu Pani pila pila kyu? Gol kyu hain Zameen?
Rohan Bhamre removed +91 99209 22667
Rohan Bhamre added +91 99209 22667
Rohan Bhamre: @919920922667 you were saying
Kartik Vermun: @919422709999 that does sound convincing but do you believe that can be the only reason for a truly global society
Kartik Vermun: An outside danger ie
Rohan Bhamre: I wouldn't talk in absolutes
Rohan Bhamre: But yes humans only unite against a common threat
Rohan Bhamre: 99.99999999999999999
Rohan Bhamre: In absence of that, we compete
+91 99209 22667: Nations are there because of kingdoms. Kingdoms because of tribes. Tribes because of clans. Clans because they acted as a protective family. It requires an entire clan to raise homo sapien children while we were foragers. We are social animals and cooperation, not competition, is our dominant trait.
Ambikesh Mishra: I agree! Humans place self preservation and self interest above most things usually. They chose competition or cooperation depending on their self interest. While they may not act this rationally all the time. Usually human society has tended to move in a direction that has served the self interest of the species
Ambikesh Mishra: A global nation is just not an idealistic humane notion. It's also serves self interest globally. Eventually humans will be smart enough to realize that
Ambikesh Mishra: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: The only reason it is extremely hard to realize is the 'law of inertia' or in other words the tendency of humans to preserve status quo
Kartik Vermun: Self interest maybe above self preservation
Rohan Bhamre: Because of threats
Rohan Bhamre: You just missed my entire point
Ambikesh Mishra: Threat is just a single stimilus for self interest
Ambikesh Mishra: There are many more and sometimes more important than threat
Ambikesh Mishra: Greed and ambitions are huge ones for example
Arpit Saxena: The only reason we reached the moon was the cold war
Arpit Saxena: Now NASA says it doesn't have funds for mars trip
+91 99209 22667: Humans are rarely rational these days, and very highly governed by feelings and emotions. The masters at the top use these feelings and create stories to manipulate people to serve their self-interests.
Kartik Vermun: Wtf @917407650530 back from the dead

Arpit Saxena: I rate 1 for execution
Rohan Bhamre: Those were blunt swords
Rohan Bhamre: BTW did you notice
Rohan Bhamre: How his arms were reacting
Rohan Bhamre: When hit at the neck
Arpit Saxena: The funniest part was
Rohan Bhamre: Even though he is unconscious
Arpit Saxena: When the blue guy came back

Aniket Awasthi: Dulhe ka hai?
Rohan Bhamre: Ha be

Rohan Bhamre: We form nation to compete other nations, tribes to compete with other tribes, clans to compete with other clans and so on and on... Yes we co operate
Rohan Bhamre: But you are entirely missing my point.
Rohan Bhamre: Of course humans co operate
Rohan Bhamre: AGAINST A COMMON THREAT
Rohan Bhamre: I am talking about the level which ambikesh and I were discussing
Rohan Bhamre: A singular global order
Rohan Bhamre: All of humanity won't cooperate like nation people in a nation do unless there is global threat or competition to humanity
Rohan Bhamre: Take India for example
Rohan Bhamre: All the mediocre people who give importance to caste religion or another community will be at each other's throats
Rohan Bhamre: But when there is a match against Pakistan sab bolenge Bharat mata ki jay
Rohan Bhamre: That's probably a very crude example
Rohan Bhamre: But basically human societal institutions are structured to co operate WITH A COMMON GOAL.
Rohan Bhamre: Namely to survive and thrive against nature/other humans/ other socities
Rohan Bhamre: Have you seen the movie WATCHMEN
Ambikesh Mishra: I guess you have point. Human beings are lazy and petty until under threat. Self interest too is governed by threat now that I think of it some of the time. What do you think of expansionist policies though. The human thirst for wanting more and more does not involve threat. Can't that be a motive for unification?
Rohan Bhamre: Ambikesh
Ambikesh Mishra: No I haven't
Rohan Bhamre: When I say threat I mean it broadly
Rohan Bhamre: What I really mean is a common goal
Rohan Bhamre: Like how climate change is getting countries tofether
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying we should think about other aspects too
Rohan Bhamre: Go and watch this damned movie it's fucking amazing
Kartik Vermun: Too long
Ambikesh Mishra: Other than threat that can act as incentive s
Kartik Vermun: Gets boring towards the end
Rohan Bhamre: Certainly. The current arrangement seems very primitive to me as well
Ambikesh Mishra: I'll try it
Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking have to buy everything here
Ambikesh Mishra: No piracy
Kartik Vermun: Wtf
Ambikesh Mishra: Makes it hard to watch shit
Rohan Bhamre changed the subject from "sWing" to "Watch the movie WATCHMEN"
Rohan Bhamre: Europeans incurred heavy trade tarifs if they traded with the easy through the Arabs. To avoid that they tried sending their merchents directly to East. But Arab pirates used to kill them. This is the sole reason they carried out explorations. To find direct route to east.

Kartik Vermun: conference this sunday
Aniket Awasthi: Peace
Kartik Vermun: sab log batao kitne baje
Kartik Vermun: afternoon ya evening
Aniket Awasthi: Anytime
Kartik Vermun: does education make one an atheist
Kartik Vermun: ??
Kartik Vermun: okay how many of u believe in god?
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: I don't believe in God
Aniket Awasthi: Social institutions make you atheist
Kartik Vermun: what does that mean?
Aniket Awasthi: 60 percent amreeki are religious
Aniket Awasthi: While Europe is hardly religious
Kartik Vermun: maybe I get what ur saying
Kartik Vermun: I went to a catholic school
Kartik Vermun: daily morning prayes
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: No
Kartik Vermun: *prayers
Aniket Awasthi: Muslims who get the same education are less likely to be atheists.
Aniket Awasthi: Take many as an example
Aniket Awasthi: It's because of their social institutions. Like mosques, local gatherings. Atheism in their society is frowned upon. In hindu society it isn't frowned upon. At least in the middle class Hindu society
Kartik Vermun: agreed , my mom and I have quarrelled over this many times
+91 99209 22667: Nastikism is one of the accepted Hindu ways of life right?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Jains are nastik
Aniket Awasthi: Buddhist are agnostic
+91 99209 22667: Lol!!
Rohan Bhamre: Kartik bhul gaya kya. Manali me kitne baate kiye. Some one pointed out ashish daga. Apparently very educated and smart. And he believes in some nonsense like spirits in a cave
Rohan Bhamre: BTW good initiative
Rohan Bhamre: Arpit Satya are hopeless
Rohan Bhamre: And read about Hinduism Wikipedia. It's portrayed very nobly :')
Kartik Vermun: Nahi be yaad Hai
Kartik Vermun: Was talking about the masses in general
Kartik Vermun: Daga can be an exception
Kartik Vermun: @917407650530 had pointed out BTW
Rohan Bhamre: It's not an exception. There are plenty monotheists in the science community
Rohan Bhamre: Although much less in percentage than the general populace
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: lol
Ambikesh Mishra: Check out Robert prisigs the art of motorcycle maintenance. It delves into why well educated people have such beliefs Gives a very scientific explanation. It's not random at all or not even exception
Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's just that Asians are more sensitive compared to Wes tern society
Ambikesh Mishra: Part of that insecurity arises from them being developing nation's I guess
Aniket Awasthi: Western Muslims will also attack you if you paint Muhammad. #trueStory
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I mean there are more conservative people in every religion. More so in Islam. I am sure many conservatives Christians would frown upon that too
Ambikesh Mishra: Christian roots are in Western countries who have historically advanced more.socially.
Ambikesh Mishra: Islamic roots are in Middle east. If it truly modernises I'm.surr it will become more liberal minded
Ambikesh Mishra: I think it solely boils down to replacing supertitious beliefs with rational ones
Rohan Bhamre: Christian roots are in syria
Rohan Bhamre: Islamic roots are in Arabian peninsula
Rohan Bhamre: What's this Eastern western theory
Rohan Bhamre: Go show this cartoon in Indonesia, you will be hanged by law
Rohan Bhamre: Aleppo Damascus and Alexandria were religious centre of Christianity. Just like rome
Ambikesh Mishra: Well that's true. What I meant by roots in this context is where it flourished
Ambikesh Mishra: Europe before enlighten ment would have hanged people too
Ambikesh Mishra: It's not an Easter Western theory
Rohan Bhamre: Islam is so totalitarian, it stagnates society
Ambikesh Mishra: I just want to.point out that a society that has undergone a process of rational transformation is likely to be more liberal
Ambikesh Mishra: Irrespective of religion
Ambikesh Mishra: So is communism in n.koreaa. again it's not a problem of religion. The problem is regimes and people that use it as propoganda
Ambikesh Mishra: The same was true for Christianity during renaissance
Ambikesh Mishra: Scientist s got hanged for ridiculous things
Ambikesh Mishra: I know it's the cool thing to hate Islam but the religion itself is not the problem
Ambikesh Mishra: If you go back 400 years Islamic society was far more liberal than christianity
Ambikesh Mishra: Look at the saracens
Ambikesh Mishra: And compare that to the pope
Ambikesh Mishra: It's like blaming the symptom not the cause when people point fingers at a religion
Ambikesh Mishra: Imho
Ambikesh Mishra: Ultimately it's the people that control the propoganda machine who should take.the blame
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw I have an Indonesian friend
Ambikesh Mishra: Should show this to her :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I have not even read any of the preachings of any religion thoroughly so would love to be corrected and know why Islam is any more restrictive than very orthodox christianity or hinduism
+91 99209 22667: A) Because of it's monotheistic nature and unwillingness to accept any god other than Allah. B) because it's people have not challenged the head of the institution in the same way that Protestants challenged the Catholic domain thus allowing questioning C) majority of people in Europe where Christianity culminated are atheistic or couldn't care much about it. US remains the last bastion
Rohan Bhamre: Christianity truly flourished in Europe under the Roman empire, then later colonialism to other parts of the world
Rohan Bhamre: And I would passionately oppose Christianity as well if it remained the same for fucking 2000 years
Rohan Bhamre: Well how many communist regimes do you see in the works today. And there are 1.6 billion Muslims
Rohan Bhamre: Well the cool thing today is apparently being a libtard.
Rohan Bhamre: Ghanta. They were richer and more powerful hence perceived more glamorous. Not liberal
Rohan Bhamre: Even I haven't. I just have read history. Who cares what's written in the books. What I care is what the people do.
Ambikesh Mishra: Thats a new term
Ambikesh Mishra: :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: Sickular libtard blah blah blah
Ambikesh Mishra: I still think blaming a whole religion is not constructive or valid
Ambikesh Mishra: Too much diversity in it
Ambikesh Mishra: You alienate a lot of good.peopl e by putting labels
Rohan Bhamre: Where am I putting labels
Rohan Bhamre: My purpose is to make the world realize, a huge Reformation is much needed in Islam
Rohan Bhamre: Obviously that's not my job. Muslims leaders can only do it
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I agree with that
Ambikesh Mishra: It's too backward atm
Aniket Awasthi: He's right
Aniket Awasthi: He's right too
Aniket Awasthi: No. It's wrong
Ambikesh Mishra: I mean not many religion s accept more than 1 god
Ambikesh Mishra: Saladins kingdom was definitely more liberal than the papacy
Ambikesh Mishra: That's 1000 years ago now I guess
Aniket Awasthi: Saladin had to budge under the ulema
Aniket Awasthi: Especially when he took Jerusalem
Ambikesh Mishra: Arabs were researing all the tech while Europe was in dark agea
Aniket Awasthi: They purged mutazilli
Aniket Awasthi: Read about mutazilli
Aniket Awasthi: All their science was under the realm of Islam. It never opposed Islam
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay will look that up
Aniket Awasthi: Averos who proposed secularism was ousted
Aniket Awasthi: Their science was within the limits of Islam
Aniket Awasthi: Rather their science was proving Islam and quran correct. Every theory of theirs cited that it was Allah that is the source of this
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow they were just translating different books to Arabic
Aniket Awasthi: Most of their inventions were in engineering and architecture. Not in physics or astronomy
Ambikesh Mishra: All the Roman and Greek knowledge went to.arabs and then back to Europe
Aniket Awasthi: They translated various Hindu books
Ambikesh Mishra: They developed.techniqurs for navigation
Aniket Awasthi: From sanskrit
Ambikesh Mishra: Based on astronomy
Aniket Awasthi: Chinese did it. They just adapted it
Ambikesh Mishra: Al hasn
Ambikesh Mishra: Is credited for optics
Aniket Awasthi: Optics is again Chinese
Ambikesh Mishra: And navigation even by the western media
Aniket Awasthi: Islamic world was in the middle of the trade route
Rohan Bhamre: They used that to determine the direction of Mecca medina
Aniket Awasthi: Hence they had an advanced in this sense
Rohan Bhamre: Not to build telescope to study space
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me a Muslim scholar who said that earth is not flat
Aniket Awasthi: Advantage *
Aniket Awasthi: This is a very apologetic theory propelled by media throughout the world.
Ambikesh Mishra: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham
Ambikesh Mishra: Come on man this dude was good
Ambikesh Mishra: Let's not belittle him that he did all that for allah
Aniket Awasthi: They never apposed religion
Rohan Bhamre: Yes one awesome dude Islam rocks
Ambikesh Mishra: There were many more
Aniket Awasthi: Did they?
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me this
Ambikesh Mishra: Who preserved knowledge of the Greeks and romans
Ambikesh Mishra: It was a refined society
Rohan Bhamre: No one's belittling him. Tell me what did they use his theories for
Rohan Bhamre: Except this
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not saying it rocks or sucks. It's ideology today is antiquated but at one point in history it was the most refined part of the.world
Rohan Bhamre: And you think that's because of Islam?
Ambikesh Mishra: Navigation
Ambikesh Mishra: Scientific method
Ambikesh Mishra: Optics
Ambikesh Mishra: Charting of maps
Ambikesh Mishra: Enlighten ment scholars followed in his footsteps
Ambikesh Mishra: He's credited as the forefather of rational enlightenment
Rohan Bhamre: Or a rich empire which stood right in the middle of East and West
Ambikesh Mishra: That's my whole point. It has nothing to do with Islam
Rohan Bhamre: My point is they could've done much more if they separated religion and state
Ambikesh Mishra: But sure it was part of his identity
Ambikesh Mishra: He was a devout muslim
Ambikesh Mishra: Religious fanaticism at first glance as I read through
Ambikesh Mishra: True with any ideology be it religion, democracy, communism anything
Ambikesh Mishra: No single set of beliefs can be the best way to move society forward
Ambikesh Mishra: But when you criticize Islam you attack people identity
Ambikesh Mishra: Not the smartest way to bring about change
Ambikesh Mishra: People are bound to get defensive and it will not solve anything
Rohan Bhamre: I never say this to Muslims
Ambikesh Mishra: I meant the media debates and rhetoric in political sphere
Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying this to you so that you stop dodging problems that point to Islam so that the Islamic finally feel the pressure and start acting.
Ambikesh Mishra: True
Ambikesh Mishra: But target those who are actually the problem there
Ambikesh Mishra: Like Pakistan military honchos
Ambikesh Mishra: Or extremist mullahs
Rohan Bhamre: Who find safe refuge in Pakistan soil
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes our aim should be to isolate them from inside Pakistan too.
Ambikesh Mishra: Turn public opinion against war and against the stupid dispute in kashmir
Ambikesh Mishra: Need a Gandhi level leader.to do that
Aniket Awasthi: GG
Aniket Awasthi: WP
Ambikesh Mishra: Indeed
Rohan Bhamre: I think he is being sarcastic ambi
Ambikesh Mishra: My naivety and utopianism has no bounds
Aniket Awasthi: HAHAHAHA
Ambikesh Mishra: No shit
Ambikesh Mishra: I mean I don't know the ideal solution. But there has to be better peaceful ways to resolve conflicts. I mean lots of people would have said ggwp to Gandhi
Ambikesh Mishra: But he figure d out a way to do it
Rohan Bhamre: To divide India?
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think we would be a democracy without that route
Ambikesh Mishra: It wasn't perfect by anymeans but he ended a 200 year Regine in a totally unseen way in world.history
Ambikesh Mishra: No mean feat
Ambikesh Mishra: Modi did it in Gujarat
Ambikesh Mishra: A lot of problems there are of India's.own making
Rohan Bhamre: All problems are always one's own making
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I'm full y drunk now
Ambikesh Mishra: Should go.home and sleep before I spout more non sensical stuff
Rohan Bhamre: I mean no disrespect to Gandhi but attributing end of colonial rule to Gandhi is a bit absurd? Idk
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi didn't cause independence
Aniket Awasthi: It was FDR, army revolt, internal destruction of Britain
Rohan Bhamre: Ww1
Rohan Bhamre: 2*
Aniket Awasthi: Quit India movement was utter failure
Aniket Awasthi: Franklin D Roosevelt
Rohan Bhamre: It's sad really.
Rohan Bhamre: Wow ambi kiske saath piya
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me it's ya girl
+91 99209 22667: Yes. Learn to improve your judgement of character rather than stereotyping.
Rohan Bhamre: Wait what is this about
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf?
+91 99209 22667: There are sufficient Muslims who are not dicks, and all bhakts are
Aniket Awasthi: Mob mentality and individual mentality are different
Aniket Awasthi: Always note that
+91 99209 22667: I'll remember when I'm in the middle of a full scale riot
+91 99209 22667: Then bhakts are my best friends
Aniket Awasthi: Individual choices and social choices more often than not diverge
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZF5m-vmDzM
Ambikesh Mishra: Saw this band yesterday
Ambikesh Mishra: Friggin awesome
Ambikesh Mishra: Moral policing :face_with_tongue:
+91 99209 22667: Not really. Just advice.
Rohan Bhamre: But who is judging and stereotyping?
+91 99209 22667: The world?
+91 99209 22667: US?
+91 99209 22667: UP?
Ambikesh Mishra: True. But it's always easier to put labels than to find constructive solutions
Rohan Bhamre: What labels? What are you guys even going on about
+91 99209 22667: The stuff Bhakts don't like to hear
Rohan Bhamre: I thought you disapproved of labeling and stereotyping
Rohan Bhamre: It's ok. Go on pretending you have a higher moral ground and feel good about it.
Ambikesh Mishra: That was an interesting read
Ambikesh Mishra: Well speaking for myself, I don't care if about moral high ground s I genuinely believe Islam as a religion is not the problem.
Ambikesh Mishra: And not an effecient way to solve the issur
Ambikesh Mishra: Of terrorism sponsered by extremists of that faoth
+91 99209 22667: Bhakts are stereotypes the same ways dicks are.
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think so. It just hasn't got the stigma associated like some known ones but is stereotype nonetheless
Ambikesh Mishra: Since it's used to refer to people with a certain set of beliefs
Rohan Bhamre: I was not even talking about terrorists.
Rohan Bhamre: That's the problem, we always let the lowlives hijack the conversation
Rohan Bhamre: The terrorists and the bhakts
Rohan Bhamre: When the discussion is not even about them.
Rohan Bhamre: And the elephant in the room remains. Defiant
Ambikesh Mishra: What's the elephant?
+91 99209 22667: <Media omitted>
+91 99209 22667: Move on Muslim apologists, welcome Bhakt apologists!
+91 99209 22667: Trust me the stigma associated with it is one of the vilest
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay turning into a not so constructive discussion..thanks Shubhayan!:face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4
Rohan Bhamre: Sums up your conversational acumen
Aniket Awasthi: Lol. Ambi is still in Chester died mode
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I'm traumatized
Aniket Awasthi: This discussion was not constructive.
Aniket Awasthi: It was like a Twitter troll war
Rohan Bhamre: This discussion yearned your presence
Aniket Awasthi: It's is actually a conflict of idealism and pragmatism. Rohan is more on the pragmatic side. Ambi and Shubhayan are tilted towards idealism
Aniket Awasthi: So this conflict will never be solved
Rohan Bhamre: Can you believe I still don't have a Twitter account
Aniket Awasthi: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't either
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm thinking of leaving all social media except instagram
+91 99209 22667: Not me either
+91 99209 22667: Insta is cool!
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes photography is fun
Rohan Bhamre: What about tinder
Ambikesh Mishra: Facebook is so useless now
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: Not too bad. Needs more people and depravity to be interesting
+91 99209 22667: I'm quite pragmatic at an individual level. Judge people on face value.
+91 99209 22667: Because until I'm involved in policy formulation, armchair discussions are pretty useless
Rohan Bhamre: Chup reh chuitye. Hum kya hijde log h kya who judge people from their skin color, caste, religion.
Rohan Bhamre: It's just friends talking about something greater than themselves. Of course it's useless
Rohan Bhamre: It's a past time
Rohan Bhamre: Is social behavior lost on you
Ambikesh Mishra: Well people can only talk about stuff they have no clue about
Ambikesh Mishra: That's what makes it interesting
+91 99209 22667: I'm pretty sure hijde don't find such distinctions attractive
Rohan Bhamre: Cursing Shubhayan feels oddly satisfying
+91 99209 22667: Plus it's not like I've said anything personal
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw watching watchmen
Ambikesh Mishra: Pretty good till now
+91 99209 22667: Not a fan of social behaviour
+91 99209 22667: It's epic
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/nWZMPxFdc1A
Rohan Bhamre: In loving memory of chester
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: Did you know that the whole song crawling was 1 fucking note
Rohan Bhamre: Simple song for simple people
Ambikesh Mishra: But dude had some serious vocal skills
Ambikesh Mishra: His screams we're unreal
Ambikesh Mishra: And he could sing too
Ambikesh Mishra: Live shoes were great as well
Ambikesh Mishra: Conveyed the message powerfully in a new way
Ambikesh Mishra: Way better than supposed musical master piecea
Rohan Bhamre: I like bfmv lead singer scream. Though he sucks live. His studio scream is one of the best I've heard.
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ850Rsev18
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nwwFgqef_5g
Ambikesh Mishra: Matt is good but his screams suck live
Ambikesh Mishra: Chester was way better
Ambikesh Mishra: Oops didn't read
+91 99209 22667: These are the tone deaf people I was telling you about
Ambikesh Mishra: I didn't know Chester was tone deaf..he was the one who said that
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: I'm tone deaf
+91 99209 22667: Listen to the song. Is it one one note?
+91 99209 22667: *on
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm kind of tone deaf but all the screams are one note right?
Ambikesh Mishra: Crawl in in my skin these wounds will not heal and the next line seems like 1 note
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol it's not actually my bad
+91 99209 22667: No
Rohan Bhamre: Holy shit. You should qualify physically disabled category

Ambikesh Mishra: I want to understand how brainwashing works. How do you convince people to not think logically?
Kartik Vermun: emotions outweigh logic
Kartik Vermun: easily
Aniket Awasthi: Art of persuasion
Kartik Vermun: our mothers did this to us as kids :p

Rohan Bhamre: Damn right you are
Rohan Bhamre: I bring about lack of scientific movement in the Islamic world
Rohan Bhamre: Then you name one scientist and have the audacity to think that it constitutes a "scientific movement"
Rohan Bhamre: In 1400 years of its history
Rohan Bhamre: No more than 10 good scientists you can name
Rohan Bhamre: 10 in 1400
Rohan Bhamre: I mention*
Rohan Bhamre: Your arguments are such. You asked to be bullied
Rohan Bhamre: *ask
Ambikesh Mishra: http://www.dailymotion.com/video
Ambikesh Mishra: Watch this. Presents it more succinctly how Islamic thinking inspire d Renaissance
Rohan Bhamre: they didnt inspire
Rohan Bhamre: they influenced
Rohan Bhamre: and ofcourse they influenced
Rohan Bhamre: they were world power
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah influenced
Rohan Bhamre: their gdp constituted
Rohan Bhamre: such a large chink of world economy
Rohan Bhamre: wtf
Rohan Bhamre: OF course unka influence hoga
Rohan Bhamre: and the degree of iinfluence kitna h
Rohan Bhamre: tu bata
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't know whether you can call them similar to what China is today in terms of political positions
Rohan Bhamre: your video isnt openeing
Rohan Bhamre: guess we'll never understand the correct perspective
Ambikesh Mishra: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2cjjme
Rohan Bhamre: my point is
Rohan Bhamre: basically
Rohan Bhamre: optics only
Rohan Bhamre: is what they keep bragging about
Rohan Bhamre: like
Rohan Bhamre: their military expeditions were so successful
Ambikesh Mishra: It's no small deal :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: and their control of trade
Rohan Bhamre: gave them enormous wealth
Rohan Bhamre: which made their cities shit rich
Rohan Bhamre: of course there will be amazing culture that'll be developing
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not sure if that wealth translated to free thinking
Ambikesh Mishra: I'll just have to do more research
Rohan Bhamre: but these muslim apologists keep attributing to islam
Rohan Bhamre: the development
Ambikesh Mishra: Im not a Muslim apologist in any way
Rohan Bhamre: no
Ambikesh Mishra: Just trying to learn more
Rohan Bhamre: ok
Ambikesh Mishra: Before I form an opinion
Rohan Bhamre: not talking about u
Rohan Bhamre: but i have read so much
Rohan Bhamre: onilne
Rohan Bhamre: anyone talks shit about islam
Rohan Bhamre: they keep referring 1000 years earlier
Rohan Bhamre: the rich caliphates and their supposed contributions to the world
Ambikesh Mishra: Dude fb and blogs are low level mis informed discussions
Rohan Bhamre: their architecture is basically orthodox roman empires
Rohan Bhamre: their tech is indian and chinese
Ambikesh Mishra: Not really :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: yes
Rohan Bhamre: wait
Ambikesh Mishra: That's something I DO know about
Rohan Bhamre: should i use the fancy words how roman empire "inspired" muslim archi
Ambikesh Mishra: That's just the reality. Nothing is invented.
Ambikesh Mishra: But it's grossly wrong to say they had 0 new architecture
Rohan Bhamre: ofcourse
Ambikesh Mishra: They contribute d a ton to artistic styles, architecture
Ambikesh Mishra: And engineering
Rohan Bhamre: the problem is how people conflate the facts
Rohan Bhamre: and use them according to their narratives
Ambikesh Mishra: That's true. Making great buildings don't make them a good society
Ambikesh Mishra: Just as much as being rich doesn't make you a decent human being
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyway watch that bbc documentary series
Ambikesh Mishra: The day the universe changed
Rohan Bhamre: sure
Ambikesh Mishra: I learnt a lot from it
Rohan Bhamre: wtf
Ambikesh Mishra: Persian architecture and Adobe construction predates islam
Ambikesh Mishra: Islamic architecture is more influenced from that than Roman or greek
Ambikesh Mishra: Of course they do have influence s on it
Rohan Bhamre: persian confluence is after the islamic conquest of persioa
Rohan Bhamre: im not saying "influence"
Rohan Bhamre: have you seen orthodox churches in russia
Rohan Bhamre: they have domes
Rohan Bhamre: its classic byzantine era archi
Rohan Bhamre: its not persian
Ambikesh Mishra: Cupola and Byzantine style
Rohan Bhamre: its not fancy little "influenvce"
Rohan Bhamre: its literally thje parent of islamic archi
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's true
Ambikesh Mishra: But not giving due credit to the them for taking it to a new level is wrong
Rohan Bhamre: im giving them credit
Ambikesh Mishra: Plus the Persian confluence overpowers the original parenthood
Rohan Bhamre: you are giving them too much credit
Ambikesh Mishra: Haha soplhia is too different from a Roman basilica for example
Ambikesh Mishra: Hagia
Rohan Bhamre: over the course of time rchi does change
Ambikesh Mishra: Tru e
Ambikesh Mishra: For example.modernism doesn't have a style.predecessor
Rohan Bhamre: for all purposes you should be denouncing islam for assassinating cultures
Rohan Bhamre: persians ko chodke islam has arabised most other peoples
Ambikesh Mishra: That's like amazon destroying retail stores in US
Ambikesh Mishra: The powerful define the road
Rohan Bhamre: except im not talking about amazon
Rohan Bhamre: nor red indians in na
Rohan Bhamre: im talking about advanced civilizations
Rohan Bhamre: i agree
Ambikesh Mishra: I guess it's my way or the highway in islam
Ambikesh Mishra: Not as tolerant as other religion s
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNkQMtZAMAw @918348664817 you can lift listening to this
Kartik Vermun: yeah pretty engaging
Ambikesh Mishra: Did you know that Trump can pardon a criminal convict with just a tweet...
Ambikesh Mishra: And the attorney general can approve it by retweeting or liking it
Ambikesh Mishra: And it's all legal
Kartik Vermun: hmm judiciary system going social
Kartik Vermun: imagine if people had the power of convicting him by simply tweeting
Ambikesh Mishra: www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-
Ambikesh Mishra: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41043379
Kartik Vermun: Read this somewhere
Kartik Vermun: People who make decisions based on emotions and later try to justify them by logic are poor decision makers
Kartik Vermun: U guys agree/disagree
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Pointing fingers?
Ambikesh Mishra: Hard to distinguish between emotions with intuition/experience in many situations. I think people tend to justify the latter
Ambikesh Mishra: Agreed though
Kartik Vermun: Emotions can act as triggers
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Emotional decisions suck
Arpit Saxena: That's why they say, don't make decisions when ur very happy or very sad
Arpit Saxena: Sleep it off
Kartik Vermun: Nice fun fact
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Intuitive ones commonplace
Arpit Saxena: It's actually something we were shown in Google intro
Arpit Saxena: Write Ur email the next day
Kartik Vermun: Emotions do make you think
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well I wrote my resignation email at 3 am after downing Beer. The fact that it was logical may be attributed that I was in office at the time.
Ambikesh Mishra: Emotional or logic reinforce d with alcohol?
Kartik Vermun: Okay society will say
Kartik Vermun: Quitting Job is not logical
Kartik Vermun: But you guys do see it has an emotional angle to it
Kartik Vermun: So yeah this seems like a grey area to me
Kartik Vermun: But yeah emotional impulses are bad
Kartik Vermun: Do sleep it off
Arpit Saxena: @919422709999 @919425052635 did u guys see the dotagasm drama on r/dota2?

Rohan Bhamre: Why would you think that
Rohan Bhamre: Who the fuck cares
Rohan Bhamre: But it's actually baffling how the strength of our ego responses are. It's as strong as our survival instincts.
Arpit Saxena: What do u mean
Rohan Bhamre: It's about what kartik said
Rohan Bhamre: Just adding to it
Rohan Bhamre: When you are presented with an idea that opposes your beliefs, the same area in your brain is highlighted as when you are threatened with physical harm on you.
Arpit Saxena: Feel so sorry for S4 jebaited by a pathological liar
Aniket Awasthi: Yes

Shubhayan Ghoshal: It seems pretty dorky on his part...
Shubhayan Ghoshal: haha
Rohan Bhamre: I didn't even know the term catfish before today.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: neither me
Kartik Vermun: I did
Shubhayan Ghoshal: we wonder why.....
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Kartik Vermun: Haha
Arpit Saxena: Me neither
Arpit Saxena: He is a professional gamer so not like he has good social skills
Shubhayan Ghoshal: hmmm.... possibly... but then on the other hand we have Rohan....
Kartik Vermun: An epitome of hardcore gaming and socializing u tryin to say
Shubhayan Ghoshal: to some extent?
Kartik Vermun: Do socializing help you evade depression
Shubhayan Ghoshal: lights out at KGP seems to be based on that idea
Kartik Vermun: It momentarily takes your mind off it
Kartik Vermun: In one of his last interviews chester says that his mind went to pretty dark places during times of solitude
Arpit Saxena: It's not hard to imagine that a guy who plays video games 24x7 for 8 years has no social life
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah being with people can have a drastic effect on feeling better
Arpit Saxena: More like 12yrs
Kartik Vermun: Who is this guy?
Kartik Vermun: But it's temporary
Arpit Saxena: S4
Arpit Saxena: Ti3 winner
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup you are back to feeling shitty when alone in bed
Ambikesh Mishra: What did he do?
Arpit Saxena: Was in online relationship with a girl for 2 yrs who turned out to be fake
Kartik Vermun: :winking_face_with_tongue: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Kartik Vermun: Happened
Kartik Vermun: *happening in Japan
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol .I was reading about rich piana.Apparently he anulled his marriage after he found out his wife had married him for a greencard
Kartik Vermun: People in love with virtual characters
Shubhayan Ghoshal: anime
Kartik Vermun: Yes. Then he was dating this other girl
Kartik Vermun: Both of them pretty huge btw
Shubhayan Ghoshal: he'd need huge
Kartik Vermun: And not just the rack I mean :winking_face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Sad to see that in his wife's post the first thing she said was they were still Legally married. Fucking golddigger
Arpit Saxena: Whats wrong with these people that makes them want to go that big
Ambikesh Mishra: Exhibit A
Arpit Saxena: It looks alien
Kartik Vermun: Current state of bodybuilding competition
Ambikesh Mishra: Image that sells to gullible people
Kartik Vermun: Arnold days required you to be big and chiseled, big chest and tiny waist
Ambikesh Mishra: Same as juicing to have unreal muscle mass
Arpit Saxena: I mean Schwarzenegger looks good, this guy looks like a tumor
Kartik Vermun: People willing to cross any line to win Olympia
Kartik Vermun: Even Schwarzenegger used steroids
Kartik Vermun: But today people don't just care about aesthetics
Kartik Vermun: They seem to be judged on amount of muscle they can put on
Arpit Saxena: But he kept doing it even after he retired from bodybuilding
Kartik Vermun: Their gut tools like a pig with abs
Kartik Vermun: Hollywood
Kartik Vermun: Actors use steroids
Arpit Saxena: https://goo.gl/images/snbiU5
Arpit Saxena: The fuck
Kartik Vermun: Even in bollywood
Ambikesh Mishra: +you kind of get hooked to the thing
Ambikesh Mishra: Once you have seen how easier it is to have that much gains
Ambikesh Mishra: With half the effort
Kartik Vermun: Arpit that image is fake
Arpit Saxena: Yes but gains are just a means to an end, which is looking good
Arpit Saxena: Or lifting
Kartik Vermun: There's money involved
Arpit Saxena: Oh
Kartik Vermun: Their shows
Kartik Vermun: Their photoshoots
Ambikesh Mishra: Piana was pretty loaded. Got plenty of pussy. That's an end
Kartik Vermun: Potential career in show businesses
Kartik Vermun: His ball sack shrank, made his dick look bigger
Kartik Vermun: Due to tht
Arpit Saxena: Yeah but he would have got more if he didn't look like an alien
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: That's rich piana?
Ambikesh Mishra: Another famous juicer
Kartik Vermun: Jeff sied also juices
Kartik Vermun: No
Arpit Saxena: Yeah but he looks good
Kartik Vermun: Jeff sied
Ambikesh Mishra: But doesn't do well in competition s
Arpit Saxena: https://goo.gl/images/FiDd58
Kartik Vermun: These days it's very difficult to say who's natural
Arpit Saxena: Lifting or bodybuilding?
Ambikesh Mishra: Back acne, small balls, enlarged heart, going bald. What else?
Ambikesh Mishra: Bodybuilding.
Kartik Vermun: Just to have a good YouTube following people juice
Kartik Vermun: Rich looks better in his early videos
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah because they have like 50 percent who believe the m to be natural
Ambikesh Mishra: I guess like followers of the dera
Kartik Vermun: Later ones he became a freak
Kartik Vermun: Man, there's so much lie and deception
Kartik Vermun: https://goo.gl/images/P2JhzR

Kartik Vermun: I tried Tinder a couple of times
Kartik Vermun: Got no matches
Kartik Vermun: Stopped now
Rohan Bhamre: Idk man
Rohan Bhamre: Tinder seems very awaked to me
Kartik Vermun: Convenient
Kartik Vermun: It can get awkward
Kartik Vermun: You might expect her to be something and she's something else
Kartik Vermun: Say pure dumb
Rohan Bhamre: And vice versa
Kartik Vermun: Happened with someone I know
Kartik Vermun: Then you can't even talk
Kartik Vermun: So yeah it is fake

Rohan Bhamre: :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Rohan Bhamre: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Kartik Vermun: When I read cigarettes after sex part I was imagining a pretty open tomboy type girl
Kartik Vermun: U bought your phone

Kartik Vermun: I figured
Aniket Awasthi: So stereotypical
Kartik Vermun: Agreed
Rohan Bhamre: Soon
Kartik Vermun: First thoughts are often stereotypical
Rohan Bhamre: Most probably one pls
Aniket Awasthi: Kartik bulk kar be
Aniket Awasthi: You look weak
Kartik Vermun: Was sick this week, didn't go to gym and ate lots of food
Kartik Vermun: Gained 1 kg

Rohan Bhamre: We also have punjabis and sindhis
Rohan Bhamre: Girls
Aniket Awasthi: More the better
Rohan Bhamre: Haha fuck ruk
Rohan Bhamre: I remembered one video
Aniket Awasthi: @14043680303 will you say that she's not wearing a seat belt?
Kartik Vermun: Pretty seductive
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Use LinkedIn
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Don't come off as a despo (which happens when you use tinder)
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/9mumFb0WyuU
Rohan Bhamre: This shit is lit
Aniket Awasthi: #pro
Kartik Vermun: Bro linked serves a completely different purpose
Rohan Bhamre: So they won't suspect a thing
Rohan Bhamre: Abe Anuja ko log LinkedIn pe itna line marte h na it makes me sick
Arpit Saxena: Wow
Aniket Awasthi: So Shubhayan is right
Kartik Vermun: Chal I'll experiment
Kartik Vermun: Will start adding random chicks to my network
Rohan Bhamre: Guys see the video
Aniket Awasthi: Bekar hai be
Kartik Vermun: @14043680303 and break ice by asking for a business meeting at ccd
Rohan Bhamre: So I had gone to a career counselor
Rohan Bhamre: A fancy one in Mumbai
Rohan Bhamre: And there were these fancy college chicks over there:smiling_face:
Arpit Saxena: And one fancy college guy
Rohan Bhamre: Oh stop it you:smiling_face:
Arpit Saxena: LOL
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: Seriously though
Rohan Bhamre: Bombay ke fancy bacche
Rohan Bhamre: Have aish like fuck
Rohan Bhamre: Serious research
Aniket Awasthi: It is good
Aniket Awasthi: Hence, we must bat on our strengths. Where we are in top 20%
Aniket Awasthi: For example I can't fight in top 20% in looks department. So I'll have to be rich and resourceful
Rohan Bhamre: So what's the difference in the genders' behavior that results in this skewness
Aniket Awasthi: I don't get you
Rohan Bhamre: Why isn't it 80 percent females competing for 20 males
Aniket Awasthi: Tinder is based on looks
Aniket Awasthi: Women have less emphasis on looks than men
Arpit Saxena: There's some theory of sexual selection on this, it's 20 80 in real life too
Rohan Bhamre: Are you playing pubg
Arpit Saxena: No
Arpit Saxena: Fed up
Aniket Awasthi: It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men.
Aniket Awasthi: Jayada difference nahi hai in male and female behaviour
Arpit Saxena: That link isn't very scientific, he did it on a sample set of 27 likes he got on his fake tinder profile
Aniket Awasthi: Amma khan ye larki log mard jaise select karte apne partner logo na
Rohan Bhamre: Of course it isn't
Arpit Saxena: I'm saying it's pretty shit
Arpit Saxena: For the title
Arpit Saxena: I'm not saying it's wrong
Kartik Vermun: Studies done on such small sample sizes can make the impossible possible
Rohan Bhamre: Guys isn't it baffling that the largest religion in the world today started because a woman had to lie about her extra marital child birth
Arpit Saxena: ye
Rohan Bhamre: Marriage most foul: http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/marriage-most-foul/article19646124.ece
Rohan Bhamre: I earn 20 to 40 a day, which is hardly enough to feed my wife, six daughters, and two sons.
Rohan Bhamre: If they are this poor, why do they get the idea of breeding like pigs
Aniket Awasthi: It's their farz
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Having a child is the foremost duty for a momin
Aniket Awasthi: For example if a muslim lady dies if she's pregnant; she has a direct entry to jannat irrespective of her deeds
Kartik Vermun: It's an old school mentality, when child mortality was high
Kartik Vermun: They used to have back kids
Satya: Backup
Kartik Vermun: Also more kids meant more support labour
Kartik Vermun: But yeah they never thought about how they'll feed them
Aniket Awasthi: Bhak be
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Do you really think they aren't smart enough to know that they cannot feed their kids, but are smart enough to know they can use their kids for labor
Aniket Awasthi: These are factors but they don't explain the difference between the TFR
Aniket Awasthi: See the image
Rohan Bhamre: I already know it
Aniket Awasthi: It is their farz; huqum-e-huzur
Rohan Bhamre: Contradictory
Kartik Vermun: Okay, but what about peasants in states like UP Bihar
Kartik Vermun: Not many Muslims there
Aniket Awasthi: They still have lower TFR than muslims
Aniket Awasthi: There are
Rohan Bhamre: I wish
Kartik Vermun: Okay
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket
Rohan Bhamre: Can you spare a few days
Rohan Bhamre: For some relaxation
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: NO
Aniket Awasthi: @918348664817
Aniket Awasthi: @918101459296 your back up theory is only a half explanation
Satya: Not my theory, I was just correcting "back" to "backup" :face_with_tongue:
Satya: **backup
Rohan Bhamre: Speaking of population in general
Aniket Awasthi: Ooh
Rohan Bhamre: It's so fucking crowded in towns as well
Rohan Bhamre: I'm getting anxious
Kartik Vermun: Everywhere in India
Aniket Awasthi: I see dulhe @919422709999
Rohan Bhamre: What is this
Rohan Bhamre: 0-4 years?
Aniket Awasthi: Padh na be
Aniket Awasthi: Percentage of muslim kids
Aniket Awasthi: Sample = kids from 0-4 years of age
Rohan Bhamre: Poor information delivery
Aniket Awasthi: In 60 years you'll be seeing 30 -40 percent muslims in India
Rohan Bhamre: Lel
Rohan Bhamre: It's the highest in mumbai
Aniket Awasthi: Urban centers me jayada hai
Rohan Bhamre: I was just wondering guy's
Rohan Bhamre: Guys
Rohan Bhamre: Remembered ambi talking about gandhiji
Rohan Bhamre: And how he attributed India's independence to him
Aniket Awasthi: http://www.livemint.com/Politics/N0ehxGL9CR5rflGLIFMLwJ/Why-the-population-share-of-Muslims-in-India-falls-with-age.html
Rohan Bhamre: How big was the role of propoganda that led us actually believe that
Aniket Awasthi: See the diagram
Rohan Bhamre: How skewed was our history education
Rohan Bhamre: Led us to*
Rohan Bhamre: Not to belittle gandhiji or anything
Rohan Bhamre: My concern is historical accuracy
Rohan Bhamre: Can't help but feel gandhiji/Nehru duo were over glorified for a not so benevolent purpose
Kartik Vermun: Who did you think should be credited then?
Rohan Bhamre: Not one person
Kartik Vermun: Yeah
Rohan Bhamre: But gandhiji and nehru overshadow other personalities by far
Rohan Bhamre: I would attribute our independence to the circumstances
Kartik Vermun: Gandhi is an international symbol now
Rohan Bhamre: Of the British
Rohan Bhamre: If that leadership were really in control of events that led to our independence, then the partition should never have happened
Aniket Awasthi: You are bhagwa
Aniket Awasthi: This is RSS narrative
Rohan Bhamre: I care about the true narrative
Rohan Bhamre: What do you think is the truth
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: No tell me
Rohan Bhamre: Who on Earth though it was for the best to let the partition happen
Rohan Bhamre: *thought
Arpit Saxena: Maybe Hindus and Muslims didn't want to live with each other?
Rohan Bhamre: Then why are there still Muslims in india
Rohan Bhamre: 1-2 million loss of life
Rohan Bhamre: Largest migration in the history of humans
Rohan Bhamre: All because these leaders didn't want to hurt "Muslim sentiment"
Aniket Awasthi: The doctrine of "dar ul harab" "dar ul Islam
Aniket Awasthi: Muslims have different way of behaviour when they are in minority and when they are in majority
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking taqqiya
Rohan Bhamre: India has more Muslims than Pakistan
Arpit Saxena: Really
Arpit Saxena: Wtf
Rohan Bhamre: Not really
Rohan Bhamre: Almost the same
Rohan Bhamre: Both around 200 million
Aniket Awasthi: pakistan at 2nd
Aniket Awasthi: Indonesia being the first
Rohan Bhamre: Bc bata na
Rohan Bhamre: What's the truth then
Aniket Awasthi: I told you
Kartik Vermun: sasha cohan before release of any of his movie travels around in the same character

Aniket Awasthi: How is it possible?
Ambikesh Mishra: She is a lady doc?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: It's a test to check profession based gender bias
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Rare.... but possible...
Aniket Awasthi: What would you have answered @14043680303 ?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Adoption?
Aniket Awasthi: It was a psychological test
Aniket Awasthi: To seek for gender biases

Shubhayan Ghoshal: There goes the argument that we needs more good guys with Guns! https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/03/what-a-macho-gun-packing-instagram-star-did-when-he-was-caught-in-the-las-vegas-shooting/?utm_term=.5affdeda1696
Rohan Bhamre: 'analysis' lol this is literally gossip
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes it's more like I.dont like this guy so I'm.gonna rationalize an related to a recent incident without real arguments.
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw an article about the history of Benaras
Ambikesh Mishra: Speaks of falsification of history for propoganda
Rohan Bhamre: You need to stop doing this man. It's somehow very annoying
Rohan Bhamre: And your analogies are worse!
Ambikesh Mishra: What? What's wrong in that? The article author clearly seems to have an agenda against that Instagram star. He's formulating his opinion on gun laws based on this story. How is he not post -rationalizing? I didn't even use an analogy....
Ambikesh Mishra: The second PDF was something entirely else which you guys might be interested in...
Ambikesh Mishra: My point was that article does nothing to make a valid point against gun laws(there are many) but delves more into a personal vendetta. That's exploiting a tragedy rather than any solid argument. I'm pretty sure that was your point so I'm not sure why you are annoyed
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you hate him?
Ambikesh Mishra: The article author? I wasn't referring to Rohan here....
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you hate Dan bizlerian?
Aniket Awasthi: He didn't cover gyanvapi. :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't hate him at all. I just think that kind of rhetoric is useless and not based on logic. The point is about gunlaws. Attacking a Instagram fraud does very little to the actual problem
Ambikesh Mishra: And takes focus away from what should be talked about
Aniket Awasthi: Okay
Aniket Awasthi: This article is biased
Ambikesh Mishra: I agree
Aniket Awasthi: Why the hell did he not include gyanvapi?
Ambikesh Mishra: I am trying to guess agenda here though
Aniket Awasthi: It's a crown of Islamic architecture in varanasi
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: It focuses on Hindu hegemony and conveniently ignored the rest. Sounded suspicious. European version creating a divide though is nothing revealing though
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: This temple is just beside kashi vishwanath
Aniket Awasthi: Mosque *
Ambikesh Mishra: Beautiful it is :face_with_tongue:
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque?wprov=sfti1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque?wprov=sfti1https://maps.apple.com/?ll=25.311229,83.010461&q=Gyanvapi%20Mosque&_ext=EiQpGZEotKxPOUAxizidZKvAVEA5GZEotKxPOUBBizidZKvAVEA%3D
Aniket Awasthi: The mosque was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 CE, after destroying a Hindu temple.[3]:1 The remnants of the Hindu temple can be seen on the walls of the Gyanvapi mosque.
Aniket Awasthi: The demolished temple is believed by Hindus to be an earlier restoration of the original Kashi Vishwanath temple. The original temple had been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times. The temple structure that existed prior to the construction of the mosque was most probably built by Raja Man Singh during Akbar's reign.[5] Aurangzeb's demolition of the temple was also probably attributed to the escape of the Maratha king Shivaji and the rebellion of local zamindars (landowners). Jai Singh I, the grandson of Raja Man Singh, is alleged to have facilitated Shivaji's escape from Agra. Some of the zamindars were alleged to helped Shivaji avoid the Mughal authorities. In addition, there were allegations of Brahmins interfering with the Islamic teaching. The temple's demolition was intended as a warning to the anti-Mughal factions and Hindu religious leaders in the city.[5]
Ambikesh Mishra: Islamic agenda conveniently ignored..
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Ambikesh Mishra: I see
Rohan Bhamre: I just knew this study was fishy
Aniket Awasthi: Because it blamed marathas?
Rohan Bhamre: Arey nothing wrong with your point. Just saying that sometimes your delivery comes off as arrogant to me. But that's just me :kissing_face_with_closed_eyes:
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf dude
Rohan Bhamre: Kya sochta h yaar tu mere baare me
Rohan Bhamre: :unamused_face:
Rohan Bhamre: I do not hold Marathas on a pedestal
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Okay
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw what's up with Europe?
Ambikesh Mishra: Still on?
Kartik Vermun: Anyone wants to go to Singapore?
Kartik Vermun: Malaysia and Thailand also
Rohan Bhamre: I want to
Kartik Vermun: Cool
Aniket Awasthi: When?
Kartik Vermun: Year end
Kartik Vermun: December sometime
Aniket Awasthi: Gg
Kartik Vermun: Is this yes or know or can't say?
Aniket Awasthi: No
Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: He was a stoic
Aniket Awasthi: They always try to see the nuances
Aniket Awasthi: He was pro suicide too
Ambikesh Mishra: So he believed in tolerating religon?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But not himself
Aniket Awasthi: Religion is very important
Aniket Awasthi: Read Spinoza or neitzsche on it
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket is a ruler
Rohan Bhamre: Ruthless
Aniket Awasthi: The death of God didnt strike Nietzsche as an entirely good thing. Without a God, the basic belief system of Western Europe was in jeopardy, as he put it in Twilight of the Idols: When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.
Aniket Awasthi: http://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/what-nietzsche-really-meant-by-god-is-dead
Aniket Awasthi: His fear of the nihilism and our reaction to it was shown in The Will to Power, when he wrote that: "What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism. . . . For some time now our whole European culture has been moving as toward a catastrophe."
Rohan Bhamre: Christianity has already fallen off in Europe
Rohan Bhamre: Today Europe has the best quality of life on Earth
Rohan Bhamre: I don't see any catastrophe
Rohan Bhamre: Pehle ki baat thi be Aniket
Aniket Awasthi: You're wrong
Aniket Awasthi: You are having a time lag bias
Aniket Awasthi: You are seeing a society created by the people of older generation
Aniket Awasthi: the ones who are in their 40s or 50s
Aniket Awasthi: THe death of christianity in absolute terms in europe is from last 30 years
Aniket Awasthi: Right now the situation in europe is
Aniket Awasthi: 60 percent of the births are outside wedlock
Aniket Awasthi: Their TFR is about 1.8
Rohan Bhamre: Now you'll cite a few problems
Rohan Bhamre: And concur that there's a disaster
Aniket Awasthi: This is a major problem
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai problems kab nahi hote
Aniket Awasthi: I don't say that; their government says that
Rohan Bhamre: Every age has different problems
Rohan Bhamre: Problem h
Aniket Awasthi: Their families are destroyed
Rohan Bhamre: Lekin Barbadi nahi h
Aniket Awasthi: Can't you see the consequences ?
Rohan Bhamre: Institution of family is in peril
Rohan Bhamre: But that's hardly the fall of civilisation
Aniket Awasthi: Why not?
Rohan Bhamre: It's not irriversible
Rohan Bhamre: Although some very pessimist people might suggest
Rohan Bhamre: And Europeans are being proactive about it
Aniket Awasthi: I agree that it is not irreversible; but it is not changing anytime soon
Aniket Awasthi: European government has replaced husband with a state; now state provides for child care
Aniket Awasthi: Their children move out very soon; single mothers are not very efficient in bringing up child on her own
Ambikesh Mishra: I think the death of religion is a more urban phenomenon in Europe. It still thrives in the rest of it
Aniket Awasthi: NO
Aniket Awasthi: Rural areas bohot kam hain unke
Aniket Awasthi: 80% of their population is urban
Ambikesh Mishra: If it's similar to US that is.thats the case here
Ambikesh Mishra: So I'm extrapolating to europe
Aniket Awasthi: It is said that about 70% of europe is non religious
Aniket Awasthi: USA has 70% religious people; on the contrary
Rohan Bhamre: USA pretty religious
Ambikesh Mishra: Only.rural Us though
Ambikesh Mishra: Big cities not so much
Aniket Awasthi: :index_pointing_up:
Aniket Awasthi: 60-70%
Ambikesh Mishra: http://news.gallup.com/poll/7960/age-religiosity-rural-america.aspx
Aniket Awasthi: Europe ka poora hi alag hai
Rohan Bhamre: Guys why don't Syrian refugees go to neighbouring countries
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay what's the reason though? What's the substitute for religion for community gathering in rural Europe?
Rohan Bhamre: All across Atlantic to usa
Rohan Bhamre: Europe also not that close
Aniket Awasthi: Lets finish this firest
Aniket Awasthi: first*
Rohan Bhamre: Ambi all these ages religion and culture have been so intertwined that most forget to see the difference
Rohan Bhamre: You don't need religion to have culture
Rohan Bhamre: Social life is ensured by culture
Ambikesh Mishra: I see. I guess go hunting or trekking instead of going to a church kind of?
Rohan Bhamre: Like independece day
Rohan Bhamre: Zzzzz too long to type..
Rohan Bhamre: Already most of our social gatherings are non religious
Rohan Bhamre: The most important ones are though
Rohan Bhamre: But that's because religion had hijacked society for ages
Aniket Awasthi: Rohan is highly parochial
Aniket Awasthi: in his view
Aniket Awasthi: He talks sense as Nietzsche was saying
Aniket Awasthi: But his take is wrong
Aniket Awasthi: European society me this is a watershed event
Aniket Awasthi: The next generation will be the ones who are grown without a family
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Europe has the best quality of life because it looted everyone for centuries....
Ambikesh Mishra: I agree
Rohan Bhamre: A lot of people have looted other people
Rohan Bhamre: Keh di na libtard baat
Rohan Bhamre: You think Europeans were the only looters
Rohan Bhamre: They are rich because they knew what to do with the Duchess
Rohan Bhamre: Richess
Ambikesh Mishra: No but they were the dominant looters who had the power to manipulate discourse and propoganda
Ambikesh Mishra: Not saying they weren't smart
Rohan Bhamre: They had the best business and industrial culture
Rohan Bhamre: That's why they are at the top
Ambikesh Mishra: Read the article. It debunks that mytg
Ambikesh Mishra: *myth
Satya: Anyone reading "sapiens" ?
Aniket Awasthi: Read it
Ambikesh Mishra: I'll look at it
Satya: Good :thumbs_up:
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's correct but their version of how they got the riches is highly flawed
Aniket Awasthi: Afghans looted india for long
Aniket Awasthi: kuch nahi hua unka
Ambikesh Mishra: They didn't have any inherent cultural Superiorty before colonialization. Industrial ization was a by product of it
Aniket Awasthi: British used the loot for their industrialisation and innovation
Aniket Awasthi: Rohan aaj bet laga le
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I agree
Aniket Awasthi: from 20 years you'll see the degeneracy in europe
Aniket Awasthi: Europe khatam ho gaya hai; wahan ye momin log rule karenge
Rohan Bhamre: Exactly what I was gonna say.
Rohan Bhamre: If I was a European I'd worry the most about a demographic timebomb
Rohan Bhamre: Arey these arguments are very fishy re
Aniket Awasthi: BC mai kya keh raha tha!
Rohan Bhamre: Seem very politically motivated
Aniket Awasthi: Demographic time bomb ye hi hai
Rohan Bhamre: It is an annoying problem but I think it's unlikely they'll let it happen. I'm assuming there are smart people in Europe
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe I'm wrong
Aniket Awasthi: They are making efforts to rise the TFR
Aniket Awasthi: by giving child support; maternity benefits
Aniket Awasthi: etc
Aniket Awasthi: But the thing is that due to the fall of religion; there has been a sudden rise of individuality and nihilism
Aniket Awasthi: so women are not preferring to have kids
Rohan Bhamre: I would not necessarily co relate the two
Rohan Bhamre: I think socialism is the cause and not decline of religion
Aniket Awasthi: fall of family structure
Aniket Awasthi: Japan me there is a very large welfare state
Aniket Awasthi: Still their families are intact
Rohan Bhamre: Haha I was gonna talk about japan
Rohan Bhamre: Because their culture is very rich
Rohan Bhamre: No socialism bullshit
Rohan Bhamre: Japanese and Koreans have done westernization better than the West
Rohan Bhamre: S korea
Rohan Bhamre: Actually Japan tfr is lower even
Rohan Bhamre: Look it up
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: But that's because of their intense corporate life
Aniket Awasthi: That is because of their economic problems
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: It is not due to rise of individuality
Aniket Awasthi: Japanese are very religious
Rohan Bhamre: NO!
Rohan Bhamre: Please no aniket
Rohan Bhamre: Look it up
Rohan Bhamre: Please do not relate rise of the alleged 'individuality' (I don't think that's the right word for it, but anyway) with the fall of religion
Rohan Bhamre: I think religion is falling of science
Rohan Bhamre: And then other problem is because of Marxist ideas
Aniket Awasthi: Japanese people have had very fluid concept of religion
Aniket Awasthi: Zen Buddhism and Shitoism
Rohan Bhamre: Majority of them do not identify with either
Aniket Awasthi: 60-70 percent are buddhists and 60-70 percent are shito too
Aniket Awasthi: Bohot fluid hai unka religion
Rohan Bhamre: What about China
Aniket Awasthi: Wahan 80% atheists
Aniket Awasthi: but the surveys are very doubtful
Aniket Awasthi: because people are forced to be atheists there
Aniket Awasthi: If you want to be a member of CCP then you have to be an atheist
Aniket Awasthi: Kuch log kehete hain ki 30% of china is now christian
Aniket Awasthi: Fong Gong has about 10 cr followers there; so the CCP is suppressing Fong gong
Aniket Awasthi: So people say that they are atheists in any survey conducted
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking absolute government
Aniket Awasthi: to avoid fallout
Rohan Bhamre: Ok so why aren't Americans and Europeans feeling scammed when Syrian refugees are coming to then
Rohan Bhamre: Them
Rohan Bhamre: I'd feel scammed as fuck
Aniket Awasthi: Liberal parties their want to break the regional identities
Aniket Awasthi: there*
Rohan Bhamre: I'm assuming the general procedure during crisis which displaces people is for the refugees to go to the nearest safe County
Aniket Awasthi: No muslim country is taking them
Rohan Bhamre: Exactly and why isn't the world taking about it
Rohan Bhamre: Because they have bought the UN
Aniket Awasthi: Saudi; turkey etc are NATO allies
Aniket Awasthi: they won't condemn them
Rohan Bhamre: Pussies
Rohan Bhamre: Man
Aniket Awasthi: and refugees are good for the liberal parties
Aniket Awasthi: they want them there
Aniket Awasthi: they want a pan national European identity
Rohan Bhamre: Ambi bol kuch
Rohan Bhamre: Gn
Aniket Awasthi: IS he reading?
Ambikesh Mishra: I had to do a TA thingy
Ambikesh Mishra: Interesting discussion. I am looking to read more papers about this now
Rohan Bhamre: Please don't. You somehow always come up with papers that have fishy agenda. I mean there are tons of paper telling two things about the same issue. For every paper you cite I can come up with a paper that says otherwise (if I dig deep enough). I think the better alternative is just to read neutral sources of history and then make logical conclusions by yourself. It really may be the safer bet
Rohan Bhamre: Modern politics has unfolded in a way that the academia is abused for political agenda. If you insist on using historical research papers for your analysis, you should round up papers of all the shades, read them up, cross check, compare and all that. But I doubt you do that
Ambikesh Mishra: There's nothing such as a neutral source though....
Rohan Bhamre: You'll have to filter it
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Better to read well-researched sources than 'neutral' sources
Aniket Awasthi: Ye sociology is farzi
Aniket Awasthi: They do agenda driven research
Aniket Awasthi: Same with history
Aniket Awasthi: It depends on who funds them
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But you can make an educated guess about what is concealed through trial and error ;)
Aniket Awasthi: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: Reading well researched sources was the base assumption
Aniket Awasthi: Could you have pointed out what was concealed in this?
Aniket Awasthi: There are "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns"
Rohan Bhamre: Provide input anyway
Ambikesh Mishra: The authors of research papers have a point of view and that often is visible in what is written. The good ones I feel are those that are willing to change opinnion based on evidence and not vice versa. Highly reputed research papers with thorough research are far more insightful than a non researched neutral opinion
Rohan Bhamre: Input on the topic at hand!
Ambikesh Mishra: That's just a shoddy paper that smells of the pseudo intellectualism visible in Congress agendas
Ambikesh Mishra: Weren't we talking about political agendas? Or do you mean religion in Europe?
Rohan Bhamre: Syrian refugees
Rohan Bhamre: Why aren't neighbouring taking them and expecting USA and Europe to take them
Ambikesh Mishra: Gulf countries don't take them. They have no policies in place for refugees since the world war. However they do fund them with quwait being the largest donor. The most number of refugees are still in neighbor ing countries 2 million in turkey and 2 million in Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Jordan and Egypt don't have resources to support such an influx, hence the move to europe.
Rohan Bhamre: What's with the no policy for refugees
Aniket Awasthi: Europe ne convention join ki thee
Aniket Awasthi: UN convention on refugees
Rohan Bhamre: 1951
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Phir unke internal politics is pro refugee
Aniket Awasthi: While these arabs are very tribal
Aniket Awasthi: They always see one tribe vs the other
Rohan Bhamre: What a shame
Rohan Bhamre: Btw

Aniket Awasthi: bond*
Ambikesh Mishra: I have pretty close to an American accent now after 1 year
Ambikesh Mishra: It makes communication a lot easier
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Ambikesh Mishra: I dunno. I am friends with them and it's a group. It would make things awkward to get rejected :face_with_tongue:
Aniket Awasthi: Nothing wrong though
Aniket Awasthi: You can directly ask someone out
Aniket Awasthi: In a friendly way
Aniket Awasthi: What's there to lose?
Ambikesh Mishra: Confidence?
Aniket Awasthi: Confidence fake kar le
Ambikesh Mishra: It's 100 percent rate to get rejected. American girls don't date asians
Aniket Awasthi: Ooh
Aniket Awasthi: Get an Indian girl then?
Ambikesh Mishra: I seriously don't have time. I spend so much time at work

Rohan Bhamre: Ive already sang in American if you will
Aniket Awasthi: Self-hatred (also called self loathing) refers to an extreme dislike or hatred of oneself, or being angry at or even prejudiced against oneself. The term is also used to designate a dislike or hatred of a group, family, social class, or stereotype to which one belongs and/or has. For instance, "ethnic self-hatred" is the extreme dislike of one's ethnic group or cultural classification. It may be associated with aspects of autophobia.

Arpit Saxena: You can't be more right wing than arnab
Rohan Bhamre: Link
Arpit Saxena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiyQUhjOwY0
Arpit Saxena: he concluded the debate before it is started
Aniket Awasthi: I mean Rohan and HR have smilar way of speaking
Arpit Saxena: "debate"
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: He muffs the voices of the panelists
Arpit Saxena: i'm worried my dad watches this guy all the time
Aniket Awasthi: I also watch him
Aniket Awasthi: Good stress buster
Rohan Bhamre: I know I had noticed this way back in college
Rohan Bhamre: What's even stranger is that his father and my father look the same
Rohan Bhamre: I'll share my father's younger days pic
Aniket Awasthi: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: What was the conclusion
Arpit Saxena: Watch first 5 minutes opening statement by arnab
Rohan Bhamre: Hindu graves discovered
Rohan Bhamre: What about it
Arpit Saxena: Arnab monologue
Arpit Saxena: Uske baad
Rohan Bhamre: He is not an anchor
Rohan Bhamre: He is a participant who hosts the debate
Rohan Bhamre: Scam
Arpit Saxena: But how can u be this far right, he doesn't even acknowledge them as refugees
Arpit Saxena: He says Rohingya supporters are anti national pesuedo liberals
Rohan Bhamre: Lol
Arpit Saxena: As if all 40k are terrorist s
Rohan Bhamre: That's what you are concerned about
Arpit Saxena: He doesn't let anyone respond either
Rohan Bhamre: I must say
Rohan Bhamre: His anchoring skills
Rohan Bhamre: Are shit
Rohan Bhamre: He doesn't anchor
Rohan Bhamre: He bullies
Rohan Bhamre: Totally unprofessional
Arpit Saxena: The hypocrisy is unreal
Rohan Bhamre: What hypocrisy
Arpit Saxena: He says people are silencing him
Rohan Bhamre: Really
Arpit Saxena: And then doesn't let anyone complete his argument
Arpit Saxena: See that video na
Rohan Bhamre: Bhak be Aisa kuch bola nahi
Arpit Saxena: Abe he did
Arpit Saxena: How is this the most popular English news channel
Rohan Bhamre: Kab
Rohan Bhamre: I really hope when he says taking in Rohingya will be a security threat, you are not taking that to be him calling them terrorists?
Arpit Saxena: He says that Rohingya are a terrorist people
Arpit Saxena: I'll link timestamp holdon
Rohan Bhamre: ?
Arpit Saxena: 26.45
Arpit Saxena: It's similar but not the one I was referring to
Arpit Saxena: Dhundh raha hoon
Rohan Bhamre: Meh
Rohan Bhamre: Typical political narrative
Rohan Bhamre: Don't bother
Arpit Saxena: ???
Rohan Bhamre: I'll take your word
Ambikesh Mishra: Those production values are off the charts :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Arnab needs to hire some graphic designers for his channel
Rohan Bhamre: What do you guys think about rap
Aniket Awasthi: I like a few raps
Aniket Awasthi: It's poetry in a broadly
Aniket Awasthi: Broader view *
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's an excuse for music
Rohan Bhamre: Any song with lyrics is poetry broadly
Ambikesh Mishra: I believe guys like Mike shinoda and Eminem are poets. My friend here told me that her poetry teacher used Eminem as a reading assignment.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://youtu.be/npKCgowu-Bk
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I do really like the rap and Rajasthani vocal mashup here. The rap lyrics are from the rapster's life story.
Rohan Bhamre: Rap is the most consumed genre of music in the us.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's not music
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Just as F1 is not a sport
Rohan Bhamre: Wait lemme process thay
Rohan Bhamre: That
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's too technical, depends a huge amount on the car
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Driver's skills and tenacity accounting nonetheless
Rohan Bhamre: What do you mean by that though
Rohan Bhamre: Like it doesn't deserve to be called music
Rohan Bhamre: Or that by definition it's just a vocal delivery hence not music
Rohan Bhamre: A style of vocal delivery
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Rap in itself is not music, cuz as you said it is merely vocal delivery. Just words. It's the background that may make the genre be considered as music. Rap alone is not.
Ambikesh Mishra: It's like one of the most popular sport in UK after footy
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's not a sport!!!
Ambikesh Mishra: Why is it in the sports section of every. Website?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Plus one thing I consider for a sport is at an amateur level, is it an exercise?
Ambikesh Mishra: Or do you take the Indian governments stand here?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Like F1 at an amateur level may be go-karting, which is certainly no exercise
Rohan Bhamre: Internet results suggest that it is indeed a sport
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well even cricket is in there
Rohan Bhamre: @14043680303 what you may try to mean is that it is not accessible. But that may not imply its not a sport
Ambikesh Mishra: Those g forces are insane. Look at drivers after races and figure s on the calories burnt.. it certainly is an excercise
Shubhayan Ghoshal: At an amateur level? Go-kart?
Rohan Bhamre: Have you done go karting
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nopes, accessibility has nothing to do with the definition of sport
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The cars are just way too decisive
Rohan Bhamre: Building cars is part of the sport
Rohan Bhamre: Bet you didn't see it that way
Ambikesh Mishra: +1
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's like saying Li Dan is world number one in baddy because of his superior racket
Ambikesh Mishra: But badminton doesn't have a championship of rackets which F1 has- a constructors cup
Shubhayan Ghoshal: How does that matter?
Ambikesh Mishra: It's a team sport
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sport is played between people
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Not cars :P
Ambikesh Mishra: So is roboscoccer not sport?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Same way military conquest is a team sport
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Of course it isn't!!!
Ambikesh Mishra: Arpit will be offended :face_with_tongue:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Arpit will agree
Rohan Bhamre: The competitor in the sport isn't the driver. It's the whole team
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Which in this case are cars
Rohan Bhamre: BC itna broad. Life is a sport!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well if life is a sport, then F1 certainly can be
Ambikesh Mishra: Talking of poetry though. Have you guys seen the lyrics of papercut by Linkin Park. That part in the end: the sun goes down, I feel the light betray me. That's metaphor and poetry right there. Touches the heart

Rohan Bhamre: what a poet
Aniket Awasthi: http://elegalix.allahabadhighcourt.in/elegalix/ayodhyafiles/honsukj.pdf
Aniket Awasthi: 1. The disputed structure was constructed as mosque by or under orders of Babar. 2. It is not proved by direct evidence that premises in dispute including constructed portion belonged to Babar or the person who constructed the mosque or under whose orders it was constructed. 3. No temple was demolished for constructing the mosque. 4. Mosque was constructed over the ruins of temples which were lying in utter ruins since a very long time before the construction of mosque and some material thereof was used in construction of the mosque. 5. That for a very long time till the construction of the mosque it was treated/believed by Hindus that some where in a very large area of which premises in dispute is a very small part birth place of Lord Ram was situated, however, the belief did not relate to any specified small area within that bigger area specifically the premises in dispute. 6. That after some time of construction of the mosque Hindus started identifying the premises in dispute as exact birth place of Lord Ram or a place wherein exact birth place was situated. 7. That much before 1855 Ram Chabutra and Seeta Rasoi had come into existence and Hindus were worshipping in the same. It was very very unique and absolutely unprecedented situation that in side the boundary wall and compound of the mosque Hindu religious places were there which were actually being worshipped along with offerings of Namaz by Muslims in the mosque. 8. That in view of the above gist of the finding at serial no.7 both the parties Muslims as well as Hindus are held to be in joint possession of the entire premises in dispute. 9. That even though for the sake of convenience both the parties i.e. Muslims and Hindus were using and occupying different portions of the premises in dispute still it did not amount to formal partition and both continued to be in joint possession of the entire premises in dispute. 10. That both the parties have failed to prove commencement of their title hence by virtue of Section 110 Evidence Act both are held to be joint title holders on the basis of joint possession. 11. That for some decades before 1949 Hindus started treating/believing the place beneath the Central dome of mosque (where at present make sift temple stands) to be exact birth place of Lord Ram. 12. That idol was placed for the first time beneath the Central dome of the mosque in the early hours of 23.12.1949. 11. That in view of the above both the parties are declared to be joint title holders in possession of the entire premises in dispute and a preliminary decree to that effect is passed with the condition that at the time of actual partition by meets and bounds at the stage of preparation of final decree the portion beneath the Central dome where at present make sift temple stands will be allotted to the share of the Hindus.
Aniket Awasthi: This is ram janmbhoomi judgement by HC of allahbad.
Aniket Awasthi: This is the gist of the findings. Can anyone see the blatant demolition of logic in this?
Rohan Bhamre: What logic was demolished?
Rohan Bhamre: @18144419636 it is now that you pull up an intelligent research material
Rohan Bhamre: By leftist scholars
Aniket Awasthi: 3. No temple was demolished for constructing the mosque. 4. Mosque was constructed over the ruins of temples which were lying in utter ruins since a very long time before the construction of mosque and some material thereof was used in construction of the mosque.
Aniket Awasthi: Logically inconsistent
Aniket Awasthi: Temple tha bhi aur nahi bhi
Rohan Bhamre: They didn't say the was no temple
Rohan Bhamre: They said no temple was demolished
Aniket Awasthi: Ruins the
Rohan Bhamre: So what they said was not this
Aniket Awasthi: Okay I'll cite one analogy. You have an old home where you don't live. That house was in ruins. Some body constructed a house on that place also used some of the materials of that house.
Aniket Awasthi: Was it not demolishment
Aniket Awasthi: Moreover was that encroachment legal?
Rohan Bhamre: Legality of an act 500 years old?
Aniket Awasthi: Why not?
Rohan Bhamre: Because parties regarding the circumstances are long dead
Aniket Awasthi: Many rajas have their mahals built at that time
Rohan Bhamre: It is more of a religious sentiment rather than a civic legal issue
Aniket Awasthi: So if today I encroach your property and then I die. Will it make my act legal and close all doors for you?
Rohan Bhamre: Your kids will live
Aniket Awasthi: Have ownership
Rohan Bhamre: Your private property will go to them
Rohan Bhamre: Who was the temple owner be
Rohan Bhamre: That idiot
Aniket Awasthi: Ram lalla
Aniket Awasthi: Temples are owned by Gods
Aniket Awasthi: Legally
Rohan Bhamre: Thank God I'm not a lawyer
Rohan Bhamre: Then idk what is their reasoning
Aniket Awasthi: The thing is that my kids won't by punished. But your land will be restored to you
Rohan Bhamre: Does seem like an illegal encroachment
Rohan Bhamre: Building over a delapilated temple
Aniket Awasthi: :index_pointing_up:
Aniket Awasthi: Okay. Mai there purani zameen par kabza kar leta hun.
Rohan Bhamre: The thing was I was treating private ownership different than this
Aniket Awasthi: What is this logic?
Rohan Bhamre: It's ok
Rohan Bhamre: We will settle this with ambikesh's source
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Here's my leftist source :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw I'm a rightist in Indian politics. I support modi
Ambikesh Mishra: Though not bjb cause I have seen firsthand the corruption of shivraj Singh Chauhan with my dad being Dean and State medical exam controller
Rohan Bhamre: Which party didn't have corruption?
Rohan Bhamre: Which party so you think is more honest?
Rohan Bhamre: Congress?
Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't*
Ambikesh Mishra: Sure but you would hardly support a party who has a bad effect on the health of a family member. Congress is even worse. But that doesn't make bjp acceptable.
Rohan Bhamre: That's true
Ambikesh Mishra: Though I do appreciate the no nonsense get work done approach of modi. Wish more people in the party had that work ethic and capability
Rohan Bhamre: TBH for me there is no difference in Cong and BJP at karyakarta level
Aniket Awasthi: These all facts were debated in Allahabad HC
Rohan Bhamre: I only like BJP better because I find their brass more competant
Aniket Awasthi: These are the findings of the court
Ambikesh Mishra: I agree. Karyakarta level is just lazy goons
Ambikesh Mishra: I know. I personally found their verdict quite logical. In the present scenario with a lack of clear cut evidence in favor of one, a decision for shared use makes the most sense
Ambikesh Mishra: Maybe a cop out though
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I just find symbolism(in the semiotic sense) stupid. It's always extremely transient. Pointless to have riots over it
Rohan Bhamre: Was have been fight over less
Rohan Bhamre: Wars
Rohan Bhamre: Fought*
Ambikesh Mishra: True. But it's quite fun to analyze how religious meanings are constructed in society. It's very similar to language. The same way no one cares about Sanskrit anymore, the meaning of religious symbols also changes and goes irrelevant very quickly. It's hard to make a logical decision on events 500 years ago when the same structures probably had a whole different meaning.
Ambikesh Mishra: It's the structuralist theory in philosophy
Aniket Awasthi: I find this illogical
Aniket Awasthi: Very similar to this
Rohan Bhamre: Because private ownership isn't the same as ownership of gods
Ambikesh Mishra: Which property laws you consider though,the present ones or the one in the era of mughals? What is the legal one here
Ambikesh Mishra: It seems very problematic
Aniket Awasthi: This is utterly ridiculous
Ambikesh Mishra: Mughals conquered it so does not the property belong to them?
Aniket Awasthi: By this logic all the ruins today can be demolished and taken over
Rohan Bhamre: This is ridiculous
Rohan Bhamre: No
Rohan Bhamre: All temples today are owned by legit institutions
Aniket Awasthi: In mughal era there were lands for the Mandir
Ambikesh Mishra: Agreed. Ownership by God is ridiculous
Aniket Awasthi: You people are parochial
Aniket Awasthi: It doesn't imply God
Aniket Awasthi: But the ownership is in the "name" of God
Aniket Awasthi: Because when there's no samiti or care taker then the land is allotted to the gods
Aniket Awasthi: This system was designed by the British
Aniket Awasthi: When the civic law was formalized
Rohan Bhamre: I simply meant ownership should be in terms of objectively identifiable parties
Aniket Awasthi: Who will be the parties in a ram Mandir?
Aniket Awasthi: If there's no samiti or a guardian?
Rohan Bhamre: I guess no one
Aniket Awasthi: But that temple exists
Aniket Awasthi: But a land has to be owned by someone
Rohan Bhamre: In which case verdict goes to masjid
Rohan Bhamre: Lel
Aniket Awasthi: By your logic all the temples which are in ruins today can be taken over
Aniket Awasthi: Because they are under no one's name
Rohan Bhamre: No
Rohan Bhamre: The land is of government
Aniket Awasthi: No
Rohan Bhamre: If someone builds on it, it will be atikraman
Aniket Awasthi: It is not government land
Aniket Awasthi: You don't know anything about this
Aniket Awasthi: If it is a monument then only it is a government land
Aniket Awasthi: Else it is not
Rohan Bhamre: I never said I did:loudly_crying_face:
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not trying to refute you
Aniket Awasthi: You should understand that this clause of "God's ownership" is just to plug the loophole
Aniket Awasthi: Else people will start fighting over the property rights of temples
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow. That thing apart
Aniket Awasthi: I still find it very illogical
Aniket Awasthi: Because it acknowledged the presence of ruins of a temple
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe because even you don't understand ownership relating to this case?
Aniket Awasthi: Ownership ka kya farak padta hai
Aniket Awasthi: Think in common sense
Aniket Awasthi: They are saying ki whaan koi full fledged temple nahi tha
Aniket Awasthi: uske ruins the jo babri masjid construction me use ho gaye
Rohan Bhamre: Well my stand is not unlike yours
Aniket Awasthi: What is your stand?
Rohan Bhamre: My stand is purely based on honour thinking
Rohan Bhamre: And inconsiderate of socio political scenario
Rohan Bhamre: Build a temple already!
Rohan Bhamre: But we both know that's not possible
Aniket Awasthi: Honor thinking?
Aniket Awasthi: Building a temple is a different issue
Aniket Awasthi: My say is that whether there was a temple at that cite before babri
Aniket Awasthi: I am more interested in that
Rohan Bhamre: Let's assume credible evidence turns up there was indeed a temple
Rohan Bhamre: What then
Aniket Awasthi: nothing; just want to know the truth
Rohan Bhamre: Kya nothing
Rohan Bhamre: That's the bloody point of the case
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: I know
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf
Rohan Bhamre: I don't think the jury care much of the evidence because they already know they cannot give judgements that favours any side even by an iota lest communal tensions flare up some disaster
Rohan Bhamre: So there's that
Rohan Bhamre: I don't think their reports are any good source for truth or any meaningful scrutiny
Aniket Awasthi: I agree

Aniket Awasthi: Zakir Naik followers
Ambikesh Mishra: What do you guys think of scholarly peer review? Do you think it filters out prejudices in papers?
Kartik Vermun: What scholarly peer reviews
Kartik Vermun: The only reviews I've seen happening are done by the authors themselves
Kartik Vermun: To maintain the sanity of the material
Aniket Awasthi: Many reviews are just by their friends
Ambikesh Mishra: I meant articles published in peer reviewed journals
Ambikesh Mishra: Especially the popular ones
Ambikesh Mishra: How do they get by not being objective even after thorough vetting?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Refer well-respected journals

Kartik Vermun: I remember we guys discussing this before, the scale of measuring men on wealth and women on beauty
Kartik Vermun: He uses the same in the previous video
Kartik Vermun: Aniket said this sometime as to how women loose value over time while for men it's the opposite
Kartik Vermun: Which is maybe why we see all these men in late in their careers getting caught in sexual harassment cases
Aniket Awasthi: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: I said most of the women who don't invest in themselves lose their value
Aniket Awasthi: For example models
Aniket Awasthi: Women who are smart and who work in knowledge industry. Their value appreciates
Kartik Vermun: So it's specific to show business then
Kartik Vermun: Or women making a living of beauty
Aniket Awasthi: Or women who don't do anything
Kartik Vermun: Do you think the opposite also exists, success women sexually assaulting men
Kartik Vermun: Or it's not in their nature to do so
Kartik Vermun: *successful
Aniket Awasthi: There have been a few cases
Aniket Awasthi: But they are really exceptions
Aniket Awasthi: Very few cases

Arpit Saxena: Yes
Kartik Vermun: Cool man

Arpit Saxena: Somehow
Kartik Vermun: Yeah pretty sensational topic
Arpit Saxena: It was made in quite a hurry though, we didn't try to get much data
Arpit Saxena: Should have made a better analysis with more data
Kartik Vermun: Let that be a follow up
Kartik Vermun: Here's an idea
Arpit Saxena: Usme itna interest lana is tough
Kartik Vermun: Post it on arnab's fb page

Aniket Awasthi: Is it verified?
Arpit Saxena: Hmm couldn't find it, I though tha
Aniket Awasthi: I looked at that work
Aniket Awasthi: It has a lot of loop holes
Aniket Awasthi: First being that he has nothing as a standard to compare with
Arpit Saxena: Yeah, we didn't have time
Aniket Awasthi: I have an idea
Arpit Saxena: Bata

Aniket Awasthi: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.wired.com/2009/04/indusscript/amp
Aniket Awasthi: You can use a similar methodology to find out the ordering and the use of hotwords, sensationalisation etc
Arpit Saxena: We could do it if we can get a transcript
Arpit Saxena: And a lot of other things eg. Arnab generator

Shubhayan Ghoshal: The allocations for the new batches have just happened. Waiting for all to contact their mentors for now. Will put in a short survey for the older mentees and mentors after that.
Ambikesh Mishra: Big furore in KGP... If your measures are helping we can try it in more halls
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I feel it would be great to implement it in other halls. I'll put out the survey for the older mentors and mentees this weekend.

Aniket Awasthi: Waise they are bengali Muslim
Aniket Awasthi: They speak bengali too
Aniket Awasthi: Rohingya is an artificial ethnicity
Aniket Awasthi: Arpit has this bias
Aniket Awasthi: When he thinks about these issues
Arpit Saxena: They are suggesting that they deserve whatever is happening to them
Rohan Bhamre: It's more on the lines of "waisa karoge toh Aisa hi hoga". It's a terribly insensitive thing to say just like Rajiv Gandhi's " when a big tree falls the earth shakes". But can we not let emotions hijack my original query. Those insensitive remarks may have some truth to it.

Rohan Bhamre: Neil de Grasse is too flashy.
Rohan Bhamre: He says science is true
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe he was talking in simplistic terms for the general populace
Rohan Bhamre: But isn't he incorrect on that one
Aniket Awasthi: Science is not true. It is the closest explanation of the truth
Ambikesh Mishra: It at least looks for objective truths unlike philosophy
Aniket Awasthi: In the "scientific method" we try to get the best possible explanation possible
Rohan Bhamre: You mean the most HONEST
Aniket Awasthi: Possible explanation *

Aniket Awasthi: We say that H0 can't be accepted
Ambikesh Mishra: The idea of more dimensions is so powerful. Got me hooked
Rohan Bhamre: The one thing I feel sad about dying is that I won't know more about discoveries about the universe
Kartik Vermun: Seems like saturation
Kartik Vermun: But isn't
Ambikesh Mishra: That's another powerful idea that you are just a line segement and time is an illusion
Ambikesh Mishra: So no worries about dying
Kartik Vermun: If SpaceX pulls it off
Kartik Vermun: Will be a milestone
Aniket Awasthi: You know
Aniket Awasthi: There's a simulated universe theory
Aniket Awasthi: That we are a simulation similar to GTA
Rohan Bhamre: Please
Rohan Bhamre: It's too cheesy
Ambikesh Mishra: Agreed
Aniket Awasthi: They usually have their hypothesis on dual nature of light. Particle and a wave
Kartik Vermun: Yeah many have voided this opinion
Kartik Vermun: Comparing how games have evolved in the past
Ambikesh Mishra: The multiverse theory is pretty credible though
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Kartik Vermun: One day we won't be able to tell the difference between virtual and real world
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Ambikesh Mishra: There's michio Kaku video on that. We are pretty close to making inception a reality
Kartik Vermun: Watch Rick and morty episode simulation within simulation
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay I'll check it out
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Where the folks on this group get their hashish from is my point of interest.
Kartik Vermun: *hashish ?
Aniket Awasthi: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: Is hashish legal there?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Not in my state
Aniket Awasthi: Ganja?
Kartik Vermun: yeah I googled
Kartik Vermun: derivative of cannabis
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: It is said that ganja is native of Indian sub continent
Kartik Vermun: manali maybe the origin
Rohan Bhamre: What prompted you to say that though
Kartik Vermun: maybe he's smoking hashish right now
Shubhayan Ghoshal: This?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or this?
Aniket Awasthi: Lol
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Mostly this
Aniket Awasthi: I'm jobless
Aniket Awasthi: Do expect this shit from me
Rohan Bhamre: I told you that was too cheesy
Kartik Vermun: and i am a believer:face_with_tears_of_joy:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: This totally
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan the savage
Rohan Bhamre: That one was awesome
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Absolutely. Homo primitus. Bash them with a club.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm not saying the effects of hashish aren't awesome
Rohan Bhamre: Hmmph more like homosexual :face_with_steam_from_nose:
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Bhimbeteka. I went there today
Kartik Vermun: u travelling aniket
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Homo primitus though art too :P
Aniket Awasthi: This is from the Paleolithic times
Aniket Awasthi: No. It's near where I live
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nice introduction with the savage remark
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Still draws better than me
Aniket Awasthi: I was discussing a topic with an anarchist
Aniket Awasthi: He says that Israel is the first terrorist state of the world
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan do you agree with this?
Aniket Awasthi: This is what people do after doing hashish
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Silent crickets cricketing
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Spain wiped out Latin America natives. Certainly a country of love and belonging.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But in terms of terrorist states, look up "reign of terror" in France by ruling Jacobins in 1794. They actually referred to themselves as "terrorists"
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Terrorist state is a misnomer. Terrorism is the other side of the brutal power coin.
Aniket Awasthi: True
Rohan Bhamre: Couldn't understand a thing
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe I need some hashish
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf? Destroying the Aztec Empire and subjugating it's subjects is one thing. Wiping out natives is another
Rohan Bhamre: Well Native population crumbled so it's looks like a yes
Rohan Bhamre: But I really did not get your point
Shubhayan Ghoshal: States have been sponsoring terrorism for eons
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Obliterated the natives of a continent
Rohan Bhamre: Only central Mexico?
Rohan Bhamre: Or south America as well
Shubhayan Ghoshal: South too
Rohan Bhamre: It's complicated
Rohan Bhamre: More deaths were caused due to disease than direct violence
Rohan Bhamre: Most*
Rohan Bhamre: Not a proper answer
Rohan Bhamre: The question was very specific
Rohan Bhamre: I'm assuming that by 'first terrorist State' aniket's anarchist accomplice was meaning 'the biggest terrorist state' and not 'the first terrorist state to exist in history'
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Total anarchy to say first when you mean biggest
Shubhayan Ghoshal: @919422709999 well, you didn't follow specific answers.
Rohan Bhamre: I'm just guessing aniket's friend isn't capable of using proper adjectives. Because claiming Israel to be the first terrorist state in history is too far fetched. So I'm just assuming he meant the alternative.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Bigger than.... Amrika?
Rohan Bhamre: Well people hold all kinds of views shubhayan
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Amrika has nuked civilians.
Rohan Bhamre: There's this muslim friend of mine who says Jews are illuminati
Rohan Bhamre: HE MEANT IT
Rohan Bhamre: And Jews have captured holy land and purged true believers from their rightful home
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well, with so many enemies, makes sense to combine them into one
Rohan Bhamre: And Jews have captured holy land and purged true believers from their rightful home
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Trust me, being nuked is worse
Rohan Bhamre: Why are telling me
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan is taking violence as terrorism
Aniket Awasthi: I guess
Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking about anti jew perspective
Aniket Awasthi: Right?
Rohan Bhamre: Sigh. Texting sucks
Rohan Bhamre: Or just my texting sucks
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Violence aimed at intimidation to bend the knee
Rohan Bhamre: Imperialism
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Assholism
Rohan Bhamre: Absolutism
Rohan Bhamre: Trust me I play eu4 :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: That explains everything
Aniket Awasthi: Your texting
Rohan Bhamre: No doubt
Aniket Awasthi: People have pataoed random bandis on the chat
Rohan Bhamre: Fortunately I didn't need chat
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Who are we implying here?
Rohan Bhamre: No one
Rohan Bhamre: Rest assured
Aniket Awasthi: A few friends
Shubhayan Ghoshal: @918348664817 , @918101459296 there's still hope in chat :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
Aniket Awasthi: No one from this group
Shubhayan Ghoshal: @917407650530 there's still hope in chatbots :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
Rohan Bhamre: You know if I and Anuja ever breakup, I really don't trust I could ever gather more patience and zeal to court a girl
Rohan Bhamre: Too much energy in an otherwise easy process
Rohan Bhamre: Girls are too demanding
Rohan Bhamre: I want this I want that
Aniket Awasthi: You are lazy
Aniket Awasthi: But you're right
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Touche
Rohan Bhamre: I was talking in terms of principles
Rohan Bhamre: I'm liking the arranged marriage system more and more
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah. Here the guy can say "I want this and I want that"
Rohan Bhamre: No?
Rohan Bhamre: You think girls family don't have requirements at all?
Rohan Bhamre: And besides it's not an expectation from an individual. It's a filter they apply on numerous candidates
Rohan Bhamre: So please.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: You're right texting sucks
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe you're texting sucks as well
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sarcasm and repartee are lost
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Maybe that's just you
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Kartik Vermun: shubhayan and rohan , when r u guys getting married then ?
Rohan Bhamre: I got that. But I wrote out what I wrote just in case others actually see it as an argument :grimacing_face:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Dude! These questions are tooooo sensitive!!!
Kartik Vermun: what questions ?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Others just wanna get laid. Marriage is not on their minds.
Kartik Vermun: i don't know
Kartik Vermun: u guys were sounding like
Kartik Vermun: wise old men
Kartik Vermun: giving gyaan
Kartik Vermun: about women and all, like been there done that
Rohan Bhamre: After the climax of getting laid everyone thinks of marriage
Shubhayan Ghoshal: No after the climax of getting laid everyone thinks about the next climax of getting laid
Rohan Bhamre: And not necessarily with your laider for the lack of a better word
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Laidy?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Young foolish boys
Rohan Bhamre: *foolish young boys
Rohan Bhamre: It's all right kartik
Rohan Bhamre: You don't need to do anything
Rohan Bhamre: Arranged marriage mast ho jaega tera
Kartik Vermun: :thinking_face:
Rohan Bhamre: Arranged marriage is really good yaar. The world doesn't give enough credit to India for this
Kartik Vermun: There a new concept of arranged love
Kartik Vermun: Or not new
Kartik Vermun: But yeah couples calling it that
Rohan Bhamre: Arey nice
Rohan Bhamre: Abe where's Aniket be
Rohan Bhamre: I'm in a train to Mumbai
Aniket Awasthi: lurking
Rohan Bhamre: I need entertainment
Rohan Bhamre: Should I count on my wing mates
Rohan Bhamre: Or should I turn to other sources
Rohan Bhamre: How's tanushree
Aniket Awasthi: Romanticism is very new
Aniket Awasthi: Just 200 years
Aniket Awasthi: Prior to that love and marriage were different
Kartik Vermun: When I read this I thought this was a personal statement
Kartik Vermun: About your some new relationship
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: In general
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket and his adventures
Kartik Vermun: Bata be
Kartik Vermun: Adventures
Aniket Awasthi: Romanticism has merged marriage and love
Aniket Awasthi: The thing that you can find love and a companion in a same person
Aniket Awasthi: So arranged marriage was not looked down upon earlier
Ambikesh Mishra: I I thought is was ayushi and not tanushree. Am I behind on this?
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: Wild Ambi appears
Aniket Awasthi: He's like a sniffer
Aniket Awasthi: Always talks to the point
Rohan Bhamre: Hey we used to call ambikesh 'guy'
Rohan Bhamre: Had almost forgotten
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait, even I thought it was Aayushi
Aniket Awasthi: It is Aayushi
Rohan Bhamre: What?
Rohan Bhamre: You all know about Ayushi
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Then who is Tanushree?
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket told me to keep it a secret
Aniket Awasthi: Tanushree is "whiskey and a teacup"
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Hahahahahhahahahah
Aniket Awasthi: Whiskey in a teacup *
Aniket Awasthi: That's what her bio says
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait, so there is a real Tanushree?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Old Indori friend?
Rohan Bhamre: It's funny
Rohan Bhamre: I asked aniket how tanushree is and everyone else except Aniket commented
Aniket Awasthi: Men
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Women too
Aniket Awasthi: I also commented
Rohan Bhamre: After heavy public pressure
Aniket Awasthi: Tanushree is an Indori fried
Aniket Awasthi: Friend *
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Oo
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Soni?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Tanushree is a girl who I thought looked hot at first glance. But as we spoke and the more I looked at her pictures the more not so hot looking she got
Rohan Bhamre: I learnt that I am incredibly shallow
Aniket Awasthi: Me too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm deep :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
Aniket Awasthi: But rohan you have a long term girlfriend
Aniket Awasthi: If you were shallow you would have had many
Aniket Awasthi: I don't think you're shallo
Rohan Bhamre: Because as she got not so hot I lost a lot of my will to keep her entertained
Aniket Awasthi: Shallow
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Total
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Men
Aniket Awasthi: Happens
Aniket Awasthi: Happened with me too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Me too
Rohan Bhamre: Thanks man:smiling_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Men are not meant for monogamy
Shubhayan Ghoshal: So Soni is the one who dated everyone?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: But now she's good
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's the best I feel
Aniket Awasthi: She has matured
Aniket Awasthi: Monogamy?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: And you're semi-seeing her?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Monogamy is important for our modern society
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait... What are these images?
Aniket Awasthi: Think again @14043680303
Aniket Awasthi: Ottoman harem
Aniket Awasthi: Say this again now
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I resist downloading these temptations
Rohan Bhamre: Why?. They are very tasteful paintings
Aniket Awasthi: They are royal concubines
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Monogamy is the best
Rohan Bhamre: It doesn't have to be about base sex
Rohan Bhamre: But a sophisticated sensual art
Rohan Bhamre: I believe people should be able to appreciate this without being associated to adultery
Rohan Bhamre: What prevents us from this is sex stigma
Rohan Bhamre: It's primitive and it sucks!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It weakens the will
Rohan Bhamre: What will
Rohan Bhamre: This is exactly what I'm talking about
Shubhayan Ghoshal: And makes us less entertaining to our gfs
Aniket Awasthi: This is an Abhramic thought. Which associated sex as a taboo
Aniket Awasthi: I don't get you. Elucidate
Rohan Bhamre: Haha the corner of my eye read it ejaculate
Rohan Bhamre: Yes I'm suit
Rohan Bhamre: Silly*
Aniket Awasthi: Haha
Aniket Awasthi: Do you remember a word that ambi wrote on Facebook while he was preparing for GRE? @18144419636
Rohan Bhamre: TIL that Sikhs in the Sikh Empire only comprised of 17 percent of the population
Shubhayan Ghoshal: makes us less entertaining towards our gfs
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Ok got class bbye!
Aniket Awasthi: Bye
Kartik Vermun: Bye
Kartik Vermun: Nice to know about your love lives
Aniket Awasthi: Monogamy makes our gfs less entertaining to us over time too
Rohan Bhamre: ,?
Aniket Awasthi: Ye kahan se aaya?
Rohan Bhamre: Idk
Rohan Bhamre: Was reading Sikh history
Aniket Awasthi: India me ruling is based on castes
Aniket Awasthi: You have to gain favour of leaders of dominant caste groups
Aniket Awasthi: Even shivaji did so
Aniket Awasthi: Then after that bajirao gained support of bhosle shindey dhangars
Rohan Bhamre: Military history of Sikhs is a testament to the atrocities of Muslim rulers in India
Aniket Awasthi: Shivajis too
Rohan Bhamre: Sikhs became what Hindu Kshatriyas failed to be
Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs are over exaggerated. I'm not denying their contributions but I think that others also played significant roles
Rohan Bhamre: Contribution to what?
Aniket Awasthi: Against Muslim atrocities
Rohan Bhamre: I don't think Hindus suffered Muslim atrocities.
Rohan Bhamre: I mean like human disaster level
Rohan Bhamre: The way Sikhs did
Rohan Bhamre: Hindus made agreements with Muslims
Aniket Awasthi: You're wrong
Rohan Bhamre: Muslim rulers
Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs were a small group
Rohan Bhamre: They were
Aniket Awasthi: Similar not all Hindu groups make peace with Mughals
Aniket Awasthi: You can't compare 4 percent population with 60 percent population
Aniket Awasthi: Even in Hindus you can find 4 percent Hindus
Aniket Awasthi: Contributions of ahoms are as significant as Sikhs
Aniket Awasthi: Similarly contributions of orriya
Rohan Bhamre: For orriya it wasn't about religion
Rohan Bhamre: Nobody went there
Rohan Bhamre: Even Marathas didn't
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: It's not like that
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachit_Borphukan?wprov=sfti1https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachit_Borphukan?wprov=sfti1
Aniket Awasthi: He was the sena pati of ahoms
Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs are over exaggerated because they were supporting the British
Aniket Awasthi: British called them the martial race
Rohan Bhamre: It was a major regional power
Aniket Awasthi: Hence they got supreme positions in army and civil services
Aniket Awasthi: Also Sikhs have a major influence on Delhi hence their history is well taught
Rohan Bhamre: No that's because after 1857 mutiny British suppressed Hindu and Muslim in army ranks
Aniket Awasthi: Other's history is forgotten
Aniket Awasthi: Yes.
Aniket Awasthi: Even before that
Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs were in good equation with British till 1848
Aniket Awasthi: They even helped in getting sindh
Rohan Bhamre: I just liked their principles
Aniket Awasthi: Take it with a pinch of salt
Aniket Awasthi: That's what I'm saying
Rohan Bhamre: And put it in ass
Rohan Bhamre: .??
Aniket Awasthi: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: Yes I'm aware it's an idiom
Rohan Bhamre: Anyway I'm case of Shivaji
Rohan Bhamre: There was no conflict between Marathas and nizam
Aniket Awasthi: There were
Aniket Awasthi: Bajirao fought two battles
Aniket Awasthi: One at Bhopal and another at Palkhad
Aniket Awasthi: Then he make him surrender and collected Chauth from Nizam
Rohan Bhamre: what a glorious dance!
Rohan Bhamre: https://9gag.com/gag/aXvzqZz
Rohan Bhamre: is she afghani
Kartik Vermun: Thought it was gonna be belly dancing
Kartik Vermun: Turns out boob dancing
Rohan Bhamre: that helicopter followed by the leg flick was so sick
Kartik Vermun: Yeah that is
Rohan Bhamre: yeah boob dance seemed a bit ridiculous. but i would really love to see the full dance
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iib9yL42yWY
Rohan Bhamre: lel
Rohan Bhamre: im a scholar now
Aniket Awasthi: You could notice that. Nice
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know what is happening in Pakistan right now?
Rohan Bhamre: Hindu girls getting kidnapped and forced married-converted
Aniket Awasthi: No
Rohan Bhamre: I was just guessing
Aniket Awasthi: Their law minister omitted the work Muhammad in his oath
Rohan Bhamre: Please enlighten
Rohan Bhamre: Oh fault
Rohan Bhamre: That*
Aniket Awasthi: So all the islamists have come to the roads across Islamabad rawalpindi
Aniket Awasthi: Lahore
Aniket Awasthi: They have attacked homes of ministers
Rohan Bhamre: Pfffft he resigned yeah read that
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: He didn't fucking said Muhammad
Rohan Bhamre: Pakistan is a theocracy
Rohan Bhamre: If the victims are Muslims>blow the issue out of proportion. Hindu victims> crickets cricketing over deafening silence
Aniket Awasthi: Did read about the recent pew research study?
Aniket Awasthi: Majority Indians in their survey wants a strong authoritarian government
Aniket Awasthi: If you know what I mena
Aniket Awasthi: Mean
Aniket Awasthi: https://www.facebook.com/Tuedmnet/videos/507857606275675/ I laughed more than I should have
Rohan Bhamre: The head bang in the end did it for me
Kartik Vermun: Happy birthday Shubhayan :confetti_ball: :party_popper:

Shubhayan Ghoshal: Thanks homies :D
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: This guy is unbelievable
Rohan Bhamre: He actually wants India to condemn THAT?!
Aniket Awasthi: His core voter base is of Muslims
Aniket Awasthi: He would say that obviously
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>

Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Guys
Rohan Bhamre: Twitter is so God awful
Rohan Bhamre: People complain so much
Rohan Bhamre: And here I am complaining to you about that
Rohan Bhamre: Fuck Twitter gave me aids
Aniket Awasthi: It's a place where people just whine
Aniket Awasthi: And troll
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you take it seriously?
Rohan Bhamre: I just get annoyed
Rohan Bhamre: How much do you know about Prussia
Aniket Awasthi: I know their history since 1800s
Aniket Awasthi: That's it
Rohan Bhamre: Their military traditions were so damn fine
Aniket Awasthi: Frederick the great?
Aniket Awasthi: I just know about him
Aniket Awasthi: He defeated the ottomans
Aniket Awasthi: Battle of Venice
Rohan Bhamre: Acha so thay day you said no nations existed until treaty of Westphalia
Rohan Bhamre: There have been many treaties there
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: The concept of nation
Rohan Bhamre: So yeah
Rohan Bhamre: That was only for Germany dude
Aniket Awasthi: For Europe
Rohan Bhamre: For Germany
Aniket Awasthi: Don't call England as a nation
Aniket Awasthi: Or France
Rohan Bhamre: Why not
Aniket Awasthi: Before Westphalia
Aniket Awasthi: Because they were not really United under one political rule
Rohan Bhamre: English and French Kingdom existed way before that
Aniket Awasthi: They were fighting with Scotland
Aniket Awasthi: Nation is not the same as kingdom
Rohan Bhamre: Ok let me tell you
Aniket Awasthi: Also with whale
Rohan Bhamre: Lemme give an example
Aniket Awasthi: @14043680303
Rohan Bhamre: Do you know Austrian Hungarian state existed
Aniket Awasthi: Aise to holy Roman empire bhi tha
Rohan Bhamre: Because both the kingdoms were ruled by the same king
Rohan Bhamre: Then why not call them the same Kingdom
Rohan Bhamre: Because Austria and Hungary were different nations of different peoplee
Rohan Bhamre: Peoples
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Austrian Kingdom Hungarian Bohemia Poland Lithuania Croatia serbia
Rohan Bhamre: I can go on
Rohan Bhamre: These nations have been existing for more than thousand yes
Aniket Awasthi: Peace of West philia was a watershed event
Aniket Awasthi: Because nations recognized each other
Rohan Bhamre: Ok which treaty are you taking
Rohan Bhamre: Taking about
Rohan Bhamre: Talking
Rohan Bhamre: Exactly
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia?wprov=sfti1
Rohan Bhamre: Ok so religious wars
Rohan Bhamre: Although many other nations were involved
Rohan Bhamre: Because of political reasons
Aniket Awasthi: Some of the principles developed at Westphalia, especially those relating to respecting the boundaries of sovereign states and non-interference in their domestic affairs, became central to the world order that developed over the following centuries, and remain in effect today. In several parts of the world, however, sovereign states emerged from what was once imperial territory only after the post-World War II period of decolonization.[6] More significantly, one of major principlesthe balance of powerwas undermined in the Twentieth century. Referring to the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler said that without Wehrmacht, a "wave would have swept over Europe that would have taken no care of the ridiculous British idea of the balance of power in Europe in all its banality and stupid traditiononce and for all."
Rohan Bhamre: But in sentiment that episode only revolved around German people
Aniket Awasthi: Nation states can't exist until there is a mutual recognition of rights
Rohan Bhamre: That's what I am saying
Aniket Awasthi: I'm just saying that it was a watershed event
Rohan Bhamre: Also I have been wondering
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty?wprov=sfti1
Aniket Awasthi: Ye Sahi hai
Rohan Bhamre: Indian freedom struggle
Aniket Awasthi: Have a look
Aniket Awasthi: What about it?
Rohan Bhamre: I think Indian freedom struggle was shabby as fuck
Rohan Bhamre: Very uncoordinated
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: And I think it's taught to us wrong in our schools
Aniket Awasthi: History books just teach glorification of congress
Rohan Bhamre: It wasn't a revolution at all to me
Aniket Awasthi: That's it
Aniket Awasthi: It wasn't
Aniket Awasthi: India was the most peaceful colonies of British
Aniket Awasthi: They delegated least amount of troops for law and order in india per capita
Aniket Awasthi: Other territories were far more unstable
Rohan Bhamre: Like let's say about a common man in British India
Rohan Bhamre: I'd say 4 out of 5 commoners wouldn't give a fuck about freedom struggle
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe 3
Rohan Bhamre: Lul
Rohan Bhamre: What would you say
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: It was an elitist movement
Aniket Awasthi: Till 1930
Aniket Awasthi: Then it became communal
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Khilafat started in 1919. What Indian leaders thought to use as a tool to unite the masses ended up being used by the Brits to break the masses.
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah this as well
Rohan Bhamre: I think this is another meme sold to us by our history books
Rohan Bhamre: "British divided Hindu Muslim!"
Rohan Bhamre: Like yeah we were fucking kids
Rohan Bhamre: *like we were kids
Rohan Bhamre: I do not know about this
Rohan Bhamre: Are your sure
Shubhayan Ghoshal: They might have added to the polarization
Aniket Awasthi: Bwhaha
Aniket Awasthi: Kuch bhi Shubhayan
Aniket Awasthi: I vehemently disagree with this thought
Rohan Bhamre: I hope you know the principles behind khilafat movement
Shubhayan Ghoshal: You don't feel that Khilafat movement was used to convert religious sentiments into nationalist ones?
Aniket Awasthi: It's a hogwash
Aniket Awasthi: In swadeshi movement. Mainly Hindus participated
Aniket Awasthi: As Bengal partition was anti Hindu
Aniket Awasthi: And pro Muslims
Aniket Awasthi: India was always communal
Aniket Awasthi: There was no solidarity among religious masses
Rohan Bhamre: Swarajya*
Aniket Awasthi: I meant swadeshi movement. Swarajya was the demand by lokmanya tilak
Aniket Awasthi: 1905 wala swadeshi movement
Rohan Bhamre: Fuck I need to read Indian freedom struggle again
Rohan Bhamre: Or some one make a grand strategy game on it. it's much easier to remember that war:grimacing_face:
Rohan Bhamre: Exactly
Rohan Bhamre: Stop blaming it on British
Rohan Bhamre: Today we are blaming our politicians!
Rohan Bhamre: LUL
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Tum koi bacche thodi the
Aniket Awasthi: Ki Wo kuch bhi kar gaye
Aniket Awasthi: They used the already existing fault line
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The politicisation of communality. Who started it first, the Brits or us?
Aniket Awasthi: Us
Aniket Awasthi: Kings use to use this communal agenda all the time
Aniket Awasthi: Read shivajis letter
Aniket Awasthi: To aurangzeb
Shubhayan Ghoshal: This was good feed
Rohan Bhamre: Ummm Muslim league?
Rohan Bhamre: That is, if you are referring to the events that led to the partition
Rohan Bhamre: I may be wing
Rohan Bhamre: Wrong
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Just referring to introducing religion into Indian Freedom struggle
Rohan Bhamre: What was that about though
Aniket Awasthi: It was always there
Aniket Awasthi: India is intertwined with religion
Aniket Awasthi: It was more so 150 years ago
Aniket Awasthi: In swadeshi movement people use to take bath in ganga before going for the protest
Aniket Awasthi: Even today the war chants of various regiments in the army is "Har Har mahadev"
Aniket Awasthi: Bande matram was the song used for the protest. Bande matram is pretty religious in a way
Shubhayan Ghoshal: "The Next Sketch shows Shivaji dictating his famous letter to Aurangzeb protesting against the imposition ofJaziyaon the Hindus (2nd April 1679). His Persian Secretary, Nila Prabhu, is writing this letter, an interesting mixture of telling sarcasm, mock courtesy, sane advice and irrefutable logic"
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Interesting read!!
Aniket Awasthi: Shivaji attacked Portuguese because they were killing cows
Aniket Awasthi: Hindus never liked Muslims neither did Muslims liked Hindus
Rohan Bhamre: That was gold indeed
Rohan Bhamre: https://scroll.in/article/823072/shivaji-the-great-to-aurangzeb-the-terrible-we-see-in-our-kings-what-we-want-to-see-in-ourselves
Rohan Bhamre: Hindus never liked Muslims and neither did muslims "like" Hindus
Rohan Bhamre: I don't know why but my guts telling me it should be like and not liked
Rohan Bhamre: What do you think @14043680303 :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: Think it's because of the"did" before Muslims
Aniket Awasthi: Like
Aniket Awasthi: It should be like
Ambikesh Mishra: One of my classmates is researching on inter faith spaces for her thesis to solve religious conflicts. She has some interesting stuff on this
Ambikesh Mishra: I recently went to the London interfaith center. The have classes for primary school there to get their parents of different faiths to interact with one another
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Agreed
Shubhayan Ghoshal: On the grammar, not the statement
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Agreed. Absolute monarchs would be viewed as despots by today's standards. Akbar's harem had some 5000 women including 300 wives (and 600 men)
Rohan Bhamre: You seem to have very interesting friends ambikesh
Rohan Bhamre: Is there any similar academic discourse about atheism
Rohan Bhamre: That discourages religion
Rohan Bhamre: Waise kya interesting stuff h uske pas
Rohan Bhamre: Would love to hear
Ambikesh Mishra: No academic courses at least in my University. There is an atheist agnostic association (AAA) which has decent membership but that's about it. Pennsylvania is a pretty conservative state though.
Ambikesh Mishra: One of her advisors is a neurologist from the biology department. She has a bunch of psychoanalytical maps of the brain of which portions are active during thoughts of religious divergence/hate. One of the premises is that religious hatred/dislikes most acute ly develop in ages between 6 to 14.
Ambikesh Mishra: If it's ingrained in that age there is a 75% chance that the person is likely to chose religious bias over objective logic in such scenarios at an older age
Aniket Awasthi: Ye Sahi research hai?
Aniket Awasthi: These stats can be misleading many a times
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I'm skeptical too. But it's published in peer reviewed journal so not that shabby
Rohan Bhamre: Holy fucking shit who are these Tulsi divas people on Twitter
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Khemsawant the Sawant of Wadi, a small ruler near Vengurla on the Konkan coast in the late 1600's was named "Quemar Santo" or "The Saint Burner" by the Portuguese for his attacks on churches. :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Aniket Awasthi: See the video
Rohan Bhamre: Dude.....
Rohan Bhamre: My gawd. Libarts know no bounds
Aniket Awasthi: It's a half page article on Indian express
Rohan Bhamre: It's horrendous
Rohan Bhamre: They all know it was in good humour on a political rival.
Rohan Bhamre: Be it a man or a woman
Rohan Bhamre: Yet they make it a sexist issue. Purely to misinform for political mileage. Malicious people
Rohan Bhamre: Libtards*

Rohan Bhamre: this song is so happy and beautiful it makes me sad
Aniket Awasthi: The Law of Religion IN THE MEDIEVAL MARKET IN SAMARKAND, a city built on a Central Asian oasis, Syrian merchants ran their hands over fine Chinese silks, fierce tribesmen from the steppes displayed the latest batch of straw-haired slaves from the far west, and shopkeepers pocketed shiny gold coins imprinted with exotic scripts and the profiles of unfamiliar kings. Here, at one of that eras major crossroads between east and west, north and south, the unification of humankind was an everyday fact. The same process could be observed at work when Kublai Khans army mustered to invade Japan in 1281. Mongol cavalrymen in skins and furs rubbed shoulders with Chinese foot soldiers in bamboo hats, drunken Korean auxiliaries picked fights with tattooed sailors from the South China Sea, engineers from Central Asia listened with dropping jaws to the tall tales of European adventurers, and all obeyed the command of a single emperor. Meanwhile, around the holy Kaaba in Mecca, human unification was proceeding by other means. Had you been a pilgrim to Mecca, circling Islams holiest shrine in the year 1300, you might have found yourself in the company of a party from Mesopotamia, their robes floating in[] Excerpt From Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Yuval Noah Harari This material may be protected by copyright.

Aniket Awasthi: What's the point?
Rohan Bhamre: It was funny
Aniket Awasthi: Ooh
Aniket Awasthi: I thought that you were implying something
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FSPdgEguk
Rohan Bhamre: so the kids working in kgp canteens would constitute modern slavery?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: This slavery study is very biased and takes a western point of view
Aniket Awasthi: India has jajmani system in modern forms still popular in many rural societies
Aniket Awasthi: Child apprentices are considered as slaves
Aniket Awasthi: I am just saying that the figure of 1.3 crore is too high
Rohan Bhamre: I know
Rohan Bhamre: Wait have we discussed about this study before
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: They even consider people in jail who work or manufacture small products as slaves
Aniket Awasthi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjAv5XhK8Xo
Rohan Bhamre: Kaha se kaha chala Gaya ye banda
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: But the idea is interesting
Rohan Bhamre: I can already see where he is wrong
Rohan Bhamre: Men also give higher value to cheating than women
Rohan Bhamre: Because men obviously care more about sex
Rohan Bhamre: So the variable on both sides kinda balance each other
Rohan Bhamre: Care more about sex than women care more about sex

Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/sULM8__SBoE
Rohan Bhamre: Nostalgia anyone?
Kartik Vermun: Yup
Aniket Awasthi: Never heard this song
Kartik Vermun: Hmm
Kartik Vermun: Was really popular 20 years ago
Aniket Awasthi: Okay
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/J5aseBw4BmM
Rohan Bhamre: It pains me to see atheists ridiculed like this in the world
Rohan Bhamre: Assuming the subtitles are accurate
Kartik Vermun: The anchor seems really excited
Rohan Bhamre: I remember talking to a friend about god
Kartik Vermun: And
Rohan Bhamre: He asked me can u prove God doesn't exist
Rohan Bhamre: It's impossible
Rohan Bhamre: Level of indoctrination is so high in society.
Rohan Bhamre: Even in 21 century
Kartik Vermun: It gives people comfort
Rohan Bhamre: No doubt
Rohan Bhamre: In the mediaeval times
Rohan Bhamre: We don't need lies to comfort ourselves anymore
Kartik Vermun: People will resort to anything
Rohan Bhamre: *till premodern
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Ask them to define God
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/NHEaYbDWyQE
Rohan Bhamre: The internet is a deep and dark space
Rohan Bhamre: Be careful friends
Rohan Bhamre: Ok I was wondering why Aniket wasn't chiming in on any of this. Turns out internet suspended in his area due to dalit protests!
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Welcome back
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: Will see the videos in some time
Kartik Vermun: One day without internet
Kartik Vermun: Must have had some deep introspection
Aniket Awasthi: It involved a lot of introspection. You should try it
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Kartik Vermun: Exactly
Aniket Awasthi: Discovered a lot of old hobbies
Kartik Vermun: Wow
Kartik Vermun: Care to share
Aniket Awasthi: Music. Gardening. Photography
Ambikesh Mishra: I haven't had a laptop for 5 months now. You discover so much!
Ambikesh Mishra: Nice!
Aniket Awasthi: Internet
Aniket Awasthi: There's a difference dude
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking chambi
Rohan Bhamre: Keep up dude
Kartik Vermun: Smartphone to Hai na
Ambikesh Mishra: I mean for me my main anti social time Leach was DotA.
Aniket Awasthi: Dota is dead
Aniket Awasthi: It's losing players every week now
Ambikesh Mishra: You remember when I told you that in mess 2 years back
Ambikesh Mishra: You guys didn't believe me
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket that's not how statistics work
Aniket Awasthi: I was wrong to say that dota will remain attractive
Rohan Bhamre: Didn't expect that from you Aniket
Kartik Vermun: Didn't openai beat it last year
Rohan Bhamre: Zero statistics
Rohan Bhamre: Absolutely mediocre statistical inference
Aniket Awasthi: I told you. Dota is officially losing players every week
Rohan Bhamre: Do you expect it to grow indefinitely
Aniket Awasthi: The trend is downwards except the times, they release a new update
Rohan Bhamre: Even pubg is losing players every week
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse not; i expected it to maintain a saturation level
Rohan Bhamre: Would you call pubg dying
Aniket Awasthi: Net loss;
Rohan Bhamre: From when did it start losing players
Rohan Bhamre: I think there hasn't been enough time from that to deduce thus trend
Rohan Bhamre: This*
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: THis has been a trend since at least 6 months now
Rohan Bhamre: I think unless TI declines for 2 years it's not convincing to say DotA is dying
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not challenging that
Aniket Awasthi: dying doesn't mean dead
Aniket Awasthi: I have shown you the data too now
Rohan Bhamre: By dying I mean dying
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you say that it's not dying?
Arpit Saxena: Someone made an analysis on reddit that dota is on maintenance part of its life, not growth
Rohan Bhamre: It's temporary decline
Rohan Bhamre: The length and rate isn't convincing to call it dying
Arpit Saxena: And valve is taking steps to retain users eg. Dota plus for long term income
Arpit Saxena: Counter strike is old but not dead
Rohan Bhamre: It takes DotA for this fucker to speak in this group
Aniket Awasthi: 20% decline from the peak
Rohan Bhamre: DotA isn't just players
Rohan Bhamre: It's tournaments n shit
Rohan Bhamre: So many people who don't play
Rohan Bhamre: But watch
Rohan Bhamre: Think broader dude
Rohan Bhamre: Prize money is consistently increasing
Ambikesh Mishra: Do you still play?
Aniket Awasthi: Okay. Dying is a pop word for declining
Arpit Saxena: Lala does i think
Rohan Bhamre: Unfortunately
Kartik Vermun: Ye kahan se aaya
Rohan Bhamre: ????
Arpit Saxena: ???
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm shifting my focus to music now
Kartik Vermun: Weren't you dead
Arpit Saxena: I read everything
Aniket Awasthi: I took notice
Aniket Awasthi: Lurker max
Arpit Saxena: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Gave me a chuckle thanks
Kartik Vermun: Haha
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: So what would it take for Satya to speak here
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw anyone planning to come to California this year let me know. I can't fucking go home due to visa stuff
Rohan Bhamre: What was the name of that girl
Arpit Saxena: Nancy
Arpit Saxena: Drew
Kartik Vermun: Shiwangi shah
Kartik Vermun: Getting married
Ambikesh Mishra: Satyas :beating_heart: broke
Kartik Vermun: Oh that girl
Rohan Bhamre: Waah beta nice sophisticated references
Kartik Vermun: Nancy & satya??
Aniket Awasthi: :fire: :fire: :fire:
Kartik Vermun: ??
Aniket Awasthi: A group of assholes
Kartik Vermun: Kon be
Aniket Awasthi: She was his big time crush and us getting married
Rohan Bhamre changed the subject from "sWing" to "Shivangi shah"
Rohan Bhamre: Social experiment
Kartik Vermun: Haha
Kartik Vermun: I am sure satya is reading this
Aniket Awasthi changed the subject from "Shivangi shah" to "Shivangi Bansal"
Kartik Vermun: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: Is he going to the ceremony?
Kartik Vermun: Guys itna publi mat karo
Aniket Awasthi: Invite mila?
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Kartik Vermun: Pata tha
Kartik Vermun: Intentionally chup Hai
Satya: Bencho
Rohan Bhamre: Hehe
Kartik Vermun: It worked
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Satya changed the subject from "Shivangi Bansal" to "sWing :ghost:"
Kartik Vermun: @919422709999 experiment
Kartik Vermun: So yeah to get anyone talking
Rohan Bhamre: I may have some career prospects in psychology
Kartik Vermun: Just discuss his pain point
Kartik Vermun: Makes me wonder
Kartik Vermun: What are others pain points
Kartik Vermun: :thinking_face: :thinking_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Their ego
Kartik Vermun: No let's say Rohan
Rohan Bhamre: Why me
Kartik Vermun: OK anyone
Aniket Awasthi: Nice experiment
Aniket Awasthi: Nice subject
Rohan Bhamre: There are 7 people
Kartik Vermun: Arpit se start Karo
Kartik Vermun: Alphabetical
Rohan Bhamre: Minus Satya minus u
Rohan Bhamre: That's good
Rohan Bhamre: Arpit is too generic and boring
Rohan Bhamre: No pain point
Kartik Vermun: Hmm Arpit ka pain point
Aniket Awasthi: Rohan would probably be egotistical about being behaved like a marginalized fool in a group
Aniket Awasthi: A group who would consider him a moron
Aniket Awasthi: And Ofcourse about his girlfriend
Rohan Bhamre: As always Aniket trying to hijack the conversation
Aniket Awasthi: :Santa_Claus:
Rohan Bhamre: For Arpit I would have said he is the loser of the twins
Aniket Awasthi: Kartik gets emotional about chutiypa
Kartik Vermun: Really?
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: If I hadn't know better
Ambikesh Mishra: When are you getting married dude? You have been dating her for like 6 years now. Wtf are you doing
Rohan Bhamre: Unfortunately Apoorv is so dogshit that this pain point is impossible
Rohan Bhamre: Known
Aniket Awasthi: Nazi, grammar nazi
Rohan Bhamre: In a year or two
Rohan Bhamre: I am not correcting myself, rather I am correcting the typo
Rohan Bhamre: I don't understand this
Kartik Vermun: Me neither
Ambikesh Mishra: Nice!
Aniket Awasthi: I've seen you losing shit when people do chutiypa with you
Aniket Awasthi: Gussa ho jaata hai
Kartik Vermun: Says the guy
Aniket Awasthi: For example if someone ignores you
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah Kartik hates any sort of bs
Kartik Vermun: Who lost his shit many many times in aom
Aniket Awasthi: Yup
Kartik Vermun: Hmm never thought about it
Kartik Vermun: Actually true now when I think about it
Aniket Awasthi: You are emotional
Aniket Awasthi: Vivek se kaam lena nahi aata
Satya: https://youtu.be/7y4T7DnSeo0
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket you didn't comment on competitive scene
Aniket Awasthi: Not seen the video yet
Aniket Awasthi: Will see
Rohan Bhamre: What video
Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking about DotA figures
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: DotA isn't just a video game
Aniket Awasthi: I thought it was done
Aniket Awasthi: You're right
Rohan Bhamre: It has competitive scene
Aniket Awasthi: I'm just saying that it has saturated much before
Rohan Bhamre: Player number had
Rohan Bhamre: Has
Rohan Bhamre: But what about viewers
Aniket Awasthi: Dota is very dynamic man
Aniket Awasthi: You need to keep in touch to know about the map
Aniket Awasthi: If you fall out of touch then you face problems in viewing the game
Aniket Awasthi: Unlike foot ball or cricket
Rohan Bhamre: That's good theory
Rohan Bhamre: Have you checked what's viewership trend
Rohan Bhamre: Is it increasing or decreasing
Aniket Awasthi: I've not
Aniket Awasthi: It's very difficult to check that anyhow
Rohan Bhamre: Are you mad
Aniket Awasthi: No
Rohan Bhamre: Just go to twitch
Rohan Bhamre: They show stats
Aniket Awasthi: Twitch is just one platform
Rohan Bhamre: So what
Aniket Awasthi: And people can watch it in groups like a TV show
Aniket Awasthi: You always have error
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow
Aniket Awasthi: My point being that number of players is a good measure of popularity due to this reason
Rohan Bhamre: You saying advertising agencies have little idea
Aniket Awasthi: A person who doesn't play for long won't watch the game after years
Rohan Bhamre: Why are you making theories you don't know
Aniket Awasthi: I'm making theories just that it isn't backed by viewing data
Aniket Awasthi: It's just backed by player's data
Aniket Awasthi: And I'm just commenting on the nature of game. Am I wrong to in judging the nature of the game?
Rohan Bhamre: I am saying you can get data on viewership reliably
Aniket Awasthi: Pretty much
Aniket Awasthi: I just pointed out the errors
Aniket Awasthi: And you can't rely on twitch alone
Rohan Bhamre: Why not
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow the point is bigger
Rohan Bhamre: It's the primary stream platform
Aniket Awasthi: Twitch isn't the only platform
Aniket Awasthi: YouTube etc are also there
Aniket Awasthi: That's not the point man
Rohan Bhamre: So get data on that also
Rohan Bhamre: I'll
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: The point being that my hypothesis is that players data is pretty much a reliable indicator to judge the popularity of the game
Aniket Awasthi: Because of the nature of the game
Rohan Bhamre: I don't agree
Aniket Awasthi: If you disagree then tell me a few good points
Rohan Bhamre: Your point is it is difficult to keep up with game unless you play it
Aniket Awasthi: I also say that there had to be a define lag between playing and viewing
Rohan Bhamre: Well it is difficult to keep up but that makes you want to watch games
Rohan Bhamre: At least in my case
Aniket Awasthi: In data to show the correlation
Rohan Bhamre: If you browse DotA reddit a lot of redditors have stopped playing dota
Rohan Bhamre: But none of them have stopped watching pro scene
Aniket Awasthi: Small sample space
Aniket Awasthi: And a biased scene
Rohan Bhamre: I bet Arpit watches pro scene
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe
Aniket Awasthi: Reddit is not a good sample
Rohan Bhamre: But I imagine it's pretty similar everywhere else
Aniket Awasthi: Why would you say this?
Aniket Awasthi: Reddit people are nerds most of the time
Aniket Awasthi: Dota isn't all nerds
Aniket Awasthi: Also. Dota has saturated much before
Aniket Awasthi: 10 million active players only
Rohan Bhamre: Players is just one thing
Rohan Bhamre: You are undermining viewership
Aniket Awasthi: That's the whole hypothesis man. I'm contending that players data is a very good indicator of the heath of the whole game
Aniket Awasthi: It isn't cricket or football
Aniket Awasthi: Rules change every couple of months
Rohan Bhamre: Why not
Rohan Bhamre: It has gone competitive
Aniket Awasthi: New heroes come in
Rohan Bhamre: So what?
Aniket Awasthi: Maps change
Aniket Awasthi: Mechanics change it
Rohan Bhamre: SO WHAT
Rohan Bhamre: How does that deter players to watch
Aniket Awasthi: A person who is out of touch for a few patches can't catch up with the game.
Rohan Bhamre: Let's establish one thing
Aniket Awasthi: Unlike cricket or football
Rohan Bhamre: Viewership in DotA is still increasing
Rohan Bhamre: I'm too lazy to get data on that. But I know that prize pools of most premium tournaments is increasing. This wouldn't be possible if viewership wasn't increasing
Aniket Awasthi: By how much?
Aniket Awasthi: % wise
Aniket Awasthi: Also the decline in the players data will show a lag function in viewers data
Aniket Awasthi: I guess 4 patches of a difference will make it difficult to catch up
Aniket Awasthi: Hence a lag of about 8 -12 months
Rohan Bhamre: Game update dynamic has changed
Rohan Bhamre: Isntead of major patches it is now weekly updates
Rohan Bhamre: You can guess dude
Rohan Bhamre: Team that wins TI wins more money that previous champions combined
Aniket Awasthi: That's worse
Aniket Awasthi: It's even more dynamic now
Aniket Awasthi: That's mainly due to compendium right?
Rohan Bhamre: True
Aniket Awasthi: What's the base price that company is pitching in?
Rohan Bhamre: Compendium prize?
Rohan Bhamre: I don't know
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: The base price for TI
Aniket Awasthi: Excluding the compendium sale
Aniket Awasthi: Also I think that company won't purposefully lower the base price
Aniket Awasthi: It sends a wrong signal to the community which can lead to a higher potential loss
Aniket Awasthi: A couple of million isn't a big thing for valve
Rohan Bhamre: DotA is definitely saturating
Rohan Bhamre: But not dying
Rohan Bhamre: Players decreasing
Aniket Awasthi: Dying is a pop word man
Aniket Awasthi: Understand the sentiments behind it
Aniket Awasthi: As arpit said. It's like cs
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: Saturation
Aniket Awasthi: Much in correlation with the players data
Rohan Bhamre: Syria war re escalating!
Aniket Awasthi: For sometime
Aniket Awasthi: It's like the world War 2.
Aniket Awasthi: When all powers were trying to take as many parts of Germany as possible
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Happy Birthday Aniket :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: live long and prosper. Form a neo right-wing fiefdom.

Rohan Bhamre: Of course I meant blonde girls
Rohan Bhamre: But why would YOU think that
Rohan Bhamre: Ha
Aniket Awasthi: You didn't say blonde.
Kartik Vermun: I didn't even imply blonde
Rohan Bhamre: *blonde white girls
Ambikesh Mishra: Dude I don't even wanna be even close to the bizarro world of blondes.
Ambikesh Mishra: It's 24x7 bitching, idolizing Justin Timberlake, Justin beiber and Shawn mendes
Ambikesh Mishra: Not implying they would be remotely interested either :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: I'd love through, is she was hot
Rohan Bhamre: *live through it

Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Kartik Vermun: Wtf did I just see
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Save literature!
Aniket Awasthi: You know this has been going on since ages
Rohan Bhamre: I think I know what point you are trying to make
Aniket Awasthi: There's a concept called 'great culture' and 'lesser culture'
Rohan Bhamre: That this is how languages evolve
Aniket Awasthi: These all are lesser culture
Rohan Bhamre: Never heard of this before
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, for example these tribal dances, small town cuisines
Aniket Awasthi: They are always present
Rohan Bhamre: Or hip hop ?
Rohan Bhamre: :grimacing_face:
Aniket Awasthi: But they never become a part of the civilisation in a bigger way
Aniket Awasthi: They have a very low shelf life
Rohan Bhamre: I'm afraid that's changing
Rohan Bhamre: Would you say hip hop is more primitive
Aniket Awasthi: Actually, without technology hip hop is not possible
Rohan Bhamre: Culturally primitive
Rohan Bhamre: Not technology
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, majority of it
Rohan Bhamre: Hip Hop is the most consumed music in the world
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: You can always say that hero sells the most bikes in India
Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't mean that they are better than Harley or royal enfield
Rohan Bhamre: It's just point regarding this
Rohan Bhamre: A
Rohan Bhamre: I can tell you why
Aniket Awasthi: Why?
Rohan Bhamre: Before technologies patrons of the arts were rich people
Rohan Bhamre: Not with massive consumerism and availability to all
Aniket Awasthi: Yes,
Aniket Awasthi: It is due to interconnectivity
Rohan Bhamre: *now
Aniket Awasthi: Inter regional availability of art
Ambikesh Mishra: There's always the intellectual elite or pretenders to that group that will keep that sort of literature/art alive.
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw any good books you guys have read recently? Need something to kill time
Aniket Awasthi: The party
Arpit Saxena: What kind of books
Kartik Vermun: Read 12 rules for life
Kartik Vermun: By Jordan Peterson
Arpit Saxena: Are u a right wing bhakt
Arpit Saxena: Like Rohan
Kartik Vermun: Im an idealist
Aniket Awasthi: *Who we are and how we got here
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm a self serving narcissist
Arpit Saxena: Sapiens is good
Kartik Vermun: Will read it soon
Aniket Awasthi: Political violence in ancient India. U
Arpit Saxena: How is it?
Aniket Awasthi: Bekar
Ambikesh Mishra: Sweet sixteen party goes awry. Is that the right one?
Kartik Vermun: Padh ki poori?
Ambikesh Mishra: Robyn harding
Aniket Awasthi: No it's on communist party of China
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Random unconnected gyan hai Wo
Kartik Vermun: Yeah a lot of random topics
Aniket Awasthi: It's essentially based on stoic philosophy
Kartik Vermun: Ol
Kartik Vermun: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: One can read meditations by Marcus Aurelius
Aniket Awasthi: It's better
Aniket Awasthi: Instead of 12 rules
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay I'll start with the Party then.
Aniket Awasthi: Hindi book me. Mritunjaye - shivaji savant
Aniket Awasthi: I think it has an English translation too now
Aniket Awasthi: Originally a marathi book
Aniket Awasthi: @918348664817 read this book to know the real stoic philosophy.
Aniket Awasthi: It's based on life of karn from mahabharat
Aniket Awasthi: Aur @917407650530 be. When did you started branding people into left wing and right wing?
Aniket Awasthi: Very much influenced by Aithal?
Arpit Saxena: Just joking re
Aniket Awasthi: Ok. Wohi I was wondering
Arpit Saxena: I've become sick of these video recommendations in my utube
Arpit Saxena: Sabko mark as not interested karta hoon but they don't go away
Arpit Saxena: Jordan Peterson etc.
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: I faced that
Aniket Awasthi: I had to remove the history
Aniket Awasthi: And start as a clean slate
Arpit Saxena: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: Yaar Wo Banda pop philosophy sikhata hai. And pop philosophy is an oxymoron
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Aniket Awasthi: Wo shayad scientific method bhi follow nahi karta hai
Aniket Awasthi: To disprove a theory his go to argument is "we don't have enough proof". Aree bhai you bring one contradictory example to disprove. Not enough proof is never a good argument
Ambikesh Mishra: Dude watch videos learning how to talk to girls in bars. That's what I'm learning these days
Aniket Awasthi: How are you rolling your Rs?
Arpit Saxena: Pickup artists are even worse
Aniket Awasthi: Those days are gone now. Picking up is old
Arpit Saxena: What channels?
Ambikesh Mishra: What does that mean?
Aniket Awasthi: Now the era is of fifty shades. It's very direct
Aniket Awasthi: Your American accent.
Arpit Saxena: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: It's not bad actually
Kartik Vermun: I thought finances :winking_face_with_tongue:
Aniket Awasthi: I got that it was misleading
Ambikesh Mishra: I wish it was. It's so humbling to be rejected 9/10. Lol
Aniket Awasthi: That's because you're poor and Indian
Kartik Vermun: True that
Aniket Awasthi: Rich Asians bed a lot of white girls there
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse who can speak English
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol not true at all. Chinese are rich as fuck and they bed shit
Aniket Awasthi: Because they aren't able to speak
Ambikesh Mishra: No, I don't want to make excuses. I have to get the physical appearance and charisma to that level of confidence
Aniket Awasthi: California me second generation Asians bed a lot of women
Kartik Vermun: What's your source?
Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter much
Aniket Awasthi: Just go in a group of your chela chapati
Aniket Awasthi: Like a Don with his henchmen
Aniket Awasthi: Dress decently and tell me if you don't get girls
Aniket Awasthi: It's mainly because you're poor. Accept it
Kartik Vermun: Put an earpiece on
Aniket Awasthi: Rest everything is fine
Kartik Vermun: And Aniket will tell you what to say
Ambikesh Mishra: I get a lot of friends but that's about it. Plus wardrobe = $$$ so you're right about that
Kartik Vermun: Follow him word for word
Aniket Awasthi: It's true be. America is the heaven of individualism
Aniket Awasthi: Whan par you need to sell yourself
Ambikesh Mishra: That is very true. No one gives a fuck about anyone else
Aniket Awasthi: It's literally a social contract based society
Aniket Awasthi: You give me something. I'll give you something
Aniket Awasthi: And at the end most of the things boil down to money in America
Aniket Awasthi: Show off. I mean
Aniket Awasthi: That's why people buy Rolex and expensive apparels
Aniket Awasthi: It becomes easier to sell oneself
Ambikesh Mishra: Money and appearance help a lot but in the end learning to sell yourself with confidence is the most important I feel
Aniket Awasthi: Wo hai be
Kartik Vermun: Yup
Aniket Awasthi: Kitna chaiye tujhe
Aniket Awasthi: You know this selling up and selling down theory right?
Ambikesh Mishra: No!
Aniket Awasthi: For example. The one who initiates the conversation is automatically on a lower pedestal in a conversation especially with girls
Aniket Awasthi: Especially for sexual matters
Aniket Awasthi: Hence never initiate the conversation as you will lose the weight in the conversation
Kartik Vermun: How do you score if you don't initiate?
Aniket Awasthi: And the most depressing thing in a man is his lower ego or self worth
Aniket Awasthi: That's what I told
Aniket Awasthi: You need to sell yourself that the girl initiates. And you have an upper hand
Aniket Awasthi: Girls like being intimidated
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol I have a lot of really hot friends but the only time they ever initiate a conversation is when they have a question about architecture which is the the death knell of anything sexual to verify happening
Ambikesh Mishra: "ever
Aniket Awasthi: Example can be Don't start a conversation. Just do some random questioning. "Can you tell me the time? My phone just died "
Aniket Awasthi: "What's that fragrance that you're wearing?"
Aniket Awasthi: Just one question and move away
Aniket Awasthi: No other question
Kartik Vermun: Cheesy
Aniket Awasthi: Then sit somewhere you can be noticed
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah they will be like: okay here's a creepy guy
Aniket Awasthi: And obererve if she is seeing you
Kartik Vermun: Lol
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: How? How's it creepy?
Aniket Awasthi: You asked the time
Aniket Awasthi: Or some very general question
Aniket Awasthi: Non sexual
Ambikesh Mishra: But those conversations lead nowhere
Ambikesh Mishra: And the girls will keep the conversation non sexual unless they are interested in you which never happens lol
Aniket Awasthi: If she observes you then you can go the next time and initiate some good conversation
Ambikesh Mishra: That's usually means talking about Ke$ha and her prom dates
Aniket Awasthi: That's where expensive apparels help
Aniket Awasthi: This is the bar trick
Aniket Awasthi: Bars wagera me normal non intellectual crowd hone ki probability jayada hai
Aniket Awasthi: They mainly care about money from then
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I feel I need to up my dressing game and get better at saying right things at the right time
Aniket Awasthi: Rolex
Aniket Awasthi: Movado
Ambikesh Mishra: I know the girls response to that: oh wow! That's pretty much what that I've seen a Rolex get people
Aniket Awasthi: That's the whole point
Aniket Awasthi: It's about getting initial attention
Aniket Awasthi: Wohi to important hai
Aniket Awasthi: Uske baad obviously you need to know how to talk
Ambikesh Mishra: I get that a lot already in studio with just my drawings and stuff. But it never goes anywhere from there beyong friendship
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: But you can try bodybuilding and all
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me if you got laid with that
Aniket Awasthi: Many good men with better bodies are available + longer dicks
Ambikesh Mishra: Let's see. My friend tells me she thinks that being funny and confident is all that counts. If I crack the code I'll let you know lol
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Kartik Vermun: You guys can write 12 rules to get laid someday
Ambikesh Mishra: Maybe if I improve from my current hit rate of 1/50
Ambikesh Mishra: I bet someone like Rohan would be so much better at this sort of thing
Aniket Awasthi: Ambi admired Rohan. Wow :face_screaming_in_fear: :face_screaming_in_fear: :face_screaming_in_fear: :face_screaming_in_fear:
Ambikesh Mishra: https://youtu.be/FstXpvGzxZI
Ambikesh Mishra: Those who played nfsmw check out the gearbox sound of this car
Rohan Bhamre: And ugly?
Rohan Bhamre: Jus jk dude you are not ugly
Rohan Bhamre: Wait lemme read the whole chat
Ambikesh Mishra: Actually no several girls have said I look nice lol. I'm just way too polite and nice. Not charismatic enough in discussion s. That's where I think you are good. I'm actually giving you fair credit lol
Aniket Awasthi: Another back to back tareef
Ambikesh Mishra: Rohan feels embarrassed
Aniket Awasthi: Was it your plan all along? :P
Ambikesh Mishra: No I've just been salty after being friendzoned by one of the hottest girls I've known
Rohan Bhamre: Who she
Rohan Bhamre: Lemme see that
Rohan Bhamre: Bol arpit
Rohan Bhamre: Bahut bhakt kar Raha h
Rohan Bhamre: @917407650530
Rohan Bhamre: ????
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I disagree. I remember Kartik building 'monuments' in his first year.
Ambikesh Mishra: Her name is Bridget Novielli
Rohan Bhamre: Link?
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.facebook.com/bridget.novielli?tsid=0.12186778468704174&source=result
Ambikesh Mishra: She thinks we are "bros" lol
Rohan Bhamre: Ouch
Rohan Bhamre: On the other hand I'm sure you have already imagined having babies with her
Ambikesh Mishra: Well at the very least I saw a lot of movies with her. So that's something
Rohan Bhamre: Check out @ArminNavabis Tweet: https://twitter.com/ArminNavabi/status/995535942189367301?s=08
Rohan Bhamre: Some people in Iran are burning the quran
Rohan Bhamre: Can we see the theocracy in Iran any time soon
Rohan Bhamre: Toppled*
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: Ye Sab over exaggerated hai
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: This country has a 'slight' weight problem
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Do they just have burgers everyday?
Rohan Bhamre: As far I know they eat a lot of sea food
Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't make sense though
Rohan Bhamre: here is some right wing bhakt propoganda
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9vBJCMD69w
Rohan Bhamre: good chanel too
Aniket Awasthi: This pragerU is almost nonsensical
Aniket Awasthi: White supremacist
Rohan Bhamre: I'd love to investigate white supremacist content in that chanel
Aniket Awasthi: Check out their anti abortion video
Aniket Awasthi: https://youtu.be/UjGPHF5A6Po
Ambikesh Mishra: Wow such twisted logics
Ambikesh Mishra: Same with this one
Aniket Awasthi: @919422709999 :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Kya chutiyapa dekh raha hai be
Aniket Awasthi: Ambi ye dekh.
Aniket Awasthi: Has has kar gir jayega
Ambikesh Mishra: https://youtu.be/rgoj5qHN7xY
Ambikesh Mishra: I watch this channel these days
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Ye dekh aur Christianity me convert ho ja
Ambikesh Mishra: Wtf this is the American version of the kunadli and horoscope logic that aunties believe in
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Horoscope at least tells the position of stars and planets correctly
Ambikesh Mishra: I didn't know that!
Rohan Bhamre: video seems fine
Rohan Bhamre: you guys need to calm down holyshit
Ambikesh Mishra: I find the liberal propoganda more nauseating though especially the feminist ones
Ambikesh Mishra: What do you guys think of Shashi Tharoor? Does he have real credentials or just the typical Congress verbose pseudo- intellectual that has done no real work with the beauracracy?
Rohan Bhamre: He seems fine but does a lot of tu tu me me against political opponents
Rohan Bhamre: But I guess that's not his fault cuz maybe tu tu me me with political opponents is necessary to get mileage in India, or rather everywhere
Rohan Bhamre: Example of good political leader for me is like Nitin gadkari
Rohan Bhamre: Does no tu tu me me on social media and talk mostly about work
Rohan Bhamre: Talks
Rohan Bhamre: Plus his performance as transport minister is exemplary
Aniket Awasthi: He is chetta-nova
Aniket Awasthi: Laying beautiful girls left right and centre
Aniket Awasthi: chetta= friend in malayalam
Ambikesh Mishra: I see. I like the central leadership. They all seem pretty competent. Wish they could get better leaders at the state level though
Aniket Awasthi: Kiski?
Ambikesh Mishra: BjP
Aniket Awasthi: Kya be. Central leadership kahan hai?
Aniket Awasthi: Random log hain
Aniket Awasthi: Smriti irani changes ministries every year
Aniket Awasthi: Finance ministry kya kar rahi hai? Home ministry kya kar rahi hai?
Aniket Awasthi: Babus are running the government
Ambikesh Mishra: Sushma swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, nitin gadkari apart from modi and shah. Jaitley sucks The rest ones seem competent
Aniket Awasthi: Defence minister nahi tha for one year cumulative
Aniket Awasthi: Rohan might know more about defence but it's not doing very well.
Aniket Awasthi: This make in india for defence is a nightmare
Aniket Awasthi: Assault rifles import karna padti hai. Bullet proof vests imported
Ambikesh Mishra: Wasn't parrikar a good home minister?
Ambikesh Mishra: Sorry defense
Aniket Awasthi: The Rafael deal was good
Aniket Awasthi: But house keeping Sahi nahi hai. Especially defence equipment acquisition
Aniket Awasthi: Low tech products import karte hain hain
Aniket Awasthi: Bullets
Aniket Awasthi: Helmets
Aniket Awasthi: Anti fire clothing
Aniket Awasthi: But tharoor is nice
Ambikesh Mishra: Why though? Not enough know how or lack of funding?
Ambikesh Mishra: His whole experience is with the UN. Can't seem fit into anything other than external affairs
Aniket Awasthi: Nobody invests if the demand is risky. Why would some capitalist invest in bullet proof vest factory if the demand is very uncertain. And he can't even export and has no other buyer
Aniket Awasthi: Abe he's doing it at 60 what you can't at the age of 26
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Why not fund it with public money?
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol. Need to take cues from him
Aniket Awasthi: Because it's not efficient. Public owned factory are very inefficient in india. Ordinance factories today use pre 1960s equipments at times
Aniket Awasthi: He's the guru
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: I visited the one in Jabalpur quite a few times. Quite a fortress
Ambikesh Mishra: First one was way hotter
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse
Aniket Awasthi: But he gets it
Aniket Awasthi: Look at his pot belly
Aniket Awasthi: Banda Sahi hai.
Ambikesh Mishra: Lots of practice
Ambikesh Mishra: It's like DOTa. He is 6k at charming and being attractive to womeb
Ambikesh Mishra: And probably has humor much better than that :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Though wouldn't vote for him for a public office
Aniket Awasthi: Tharoor for pm
Aniket Awasthi: They should make him pm
Aniket Awasthi: Let RG be the new Sonia gandhi
Ambikesh Mishra: They should actually. Gandhi's probably have enough :money_bag: to forever own the party anyways
Ambikesh Mishra: Him vs Modi would be more interesting. It's too one sided atm
Aniket Awasthi: Don't discount congress
Aniket Awasthi: They have the largest vote share after BJP
Ambikesh Mishra: It's more likely BjP would lose than Congress winning anything
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Congress has been there many times
Aniket Awasthi: They always come back
Ambikesh Mishra: I doubt they would this time though. Nobody treats rg as remotely credible. Maybe they'll win a few more and stitch up with others. Feeling it will end up a bit like Karnataka
Ambikesh Mishra: This time I am hoping to go through the CV of major candidates :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: She is an astrologer and kundali expert. Wow
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: How does it matter
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Ambikesh Mishra: No was just wondering what conversation topics/strategies Tharoor would employ for someone like her
Rohan Bhamre: And you think he is banging her
Rohan Bhamre: The angle is amazing
Rohan Bhamre: Defence is an administrative nightmare
Rohan Bhamre: 60 years of bureaucractic decadance.
Rohan Bhamre: Good luck repairing that with a system were the government is more concerned with political survival
Rohan Bhamre: You are expecting too much from muudi
Rohan Bhamre: He will need another term for that maybe
Aniket Awasthi: No. But he can if he wants
Aniket Awasthi: Research level 9000
Ambikesh Mishra: I just did a reverse image search..
Aniket Awasthi: But you did
Ambikesh Mishra: Politics and beauracracy is so complicated. People don't vote with rational logic but often just with emotions and word of mouth
Aniket Awasthi: Aren't you a democrat ?
Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking of administration and management really
Rohan Bhamre: So many civil works offices still use files for records
Rohan Bhamre: FILES DUDE!
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm more in favor of oligarchy. Democracy is too random and just gives power in the hands of incompetent and dumb people
Rohan Bhamre: The fundamental flow lies the fact that voting is a right
Rohan Bhamre: When it is clearly a skill
Rohan Bhamre: How can a skill be a right
Rohan Bhamre: It should be a privilege
Aniket Awasthi: So you're not a democrat ?
Rohan Bhamre: Driving licence cannot be a right
Ambikesh Mishra: Cause people still don't know how to use computers? I wish a lot of Babu jobs were privatised. If you don't learn new ways to do things, you hey fired
Rohan Bhamre: Flaw
Rohan Bhamre: I'll vote Donald Trump
Rohan Bhamre: And Anuja hates me for that
Rohan Bhamre: She literally loses her shit when I say anything pro trump
Ambikesh Mishra: No I think it's a very dated system and needs to replaced with something more efficient
Ambikesh Mishra: You know I had more girls than guys in my class(around 25). I got to know nearly 14 of them voted trump
Aniket Awasthi: lol
Rohan Bhamre: Wow that sounds unbelievable
Aniket Awasthi: Nahi
Aniket Awasthi: It is true
Rohan Bhamre: College campus is a conservative nightmare from what I see on the net
Rohan Bhamre: In the usa
Aniket Awasthi: What ever california does in america; Indian upper middle class will do it 10 times more
Ambikesh Mishra: It's as simple as "my dad thinks this. My grandma thinks this". Pennsylvania is a pretty conservative place
Ambikesh Mishra: California is a whole different animal. They think they are a different country to the US
Ambikesh Mishra: Same goes with NY
Ambikesh Mishra: You go to other places and it's a very family oriented conservative place
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Indian upper class looks up to california and NY
Aniket Awasthi: They behave like that often with no reason
Aniket Awasthi: Like this
Aniket Awasthi: Why does she care about Trump? Trump has been beneficial for India in toto
Aniket Awasthi: Especially in foreign policy
Aniket Awasthi: Obama was a nightmare for India
Aniket Awasthi: Hillary would have been bad for India too
Ambikesh Mishra: Exactly! I don't get why people get so morally/ethically attached to something so distant.
Aniket Awasthi: I am telling you, you believe it or not
Ambikesh Mishra: What's so special about California though?
Ambikesh Mishra: And I don't even like NY that much
Aniket Awasthi: Hollywood
Aniket Awasthi: FRIENDS
Ambikesh Mishra: The subway system there is so inferior to London or Singapore
Aniket Awasthi: Mujhe to poore America ka urban transit system bekar lagta hai; kahan accha hai?
Aniket Awasthi: Poora america cars chalta hai
Ambikesh Mishra: Kahin nahin. America is so far behind in public infrastructure compared to Europe
Ambikesh Mishra: All their airports suck too
Aniket Awasthi: Europe is a better place to live; but the only thing they lack is conductive business environment
Aniket Awasthi: and large market like america
Ambikesh Mishra: I feel education is better in US
Aniket Awasthi: Education bhi Europe me acchi hai
Aniket Awasthi: Bas jobs nahi hai
Ambikesh Mishra: More funds to do stuff
Ambikesh Mishra: Here
Ambikesh Mishra: Hollywood is such a facile industry. Its a just Bollywood.on steroids
Ambikesh Mishra: Though I like the amount of cultural centers in NY. The plays and operas are pretty awesome
Ambikesh Mishra: Though it doesn't come close to the cultural fabric of cities like Rome or paris
Ambikesh Mishra: I honestly don't know how to fix education in India. There's so many fundamentally wrong perceptions in society
Ambikesh Mishra: And a severe lack of work ethic
Ambikesh Mishra: +California is essentially a technocratic government in it's functioning
Rohan Bhamre: Politics is downstream to culture
Rohan Bhamre: I think with Anuja it's different
Rohan Bhamre: She is very emotional when It comes to abuse against women
Ambikesh Mishra: I think politics is downstream to corporations and businesses in general in the US. The 'culture' of California is more a marketing image than anything else
Ambikesh Mishra: That's more understandable.
Aniket Awasthi: She is a liberal. Feminism is one aspect
Satya: Sunanda Pushkar death: Delhi court reserves order on summoning Shashi Tharoor till June 5 https://scroll.in/latest/880579/sunanda-pushkar-death-delhi-court-reserves-order-till-june-5-on-summoning-shashi-tharoor
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Don't worry, she is not THAT feminist
Rohan Bhamre: 3rd wave fake outrage feminist
Ambikesh Mishra: Peer pressure?
Rohan Bhamre: I don't know what you mean
Ambikesh Mishra: I have seen lots of girls express outrage to avoid being judged by their girlfriends
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah, but Anuja is not one of them is what I was saying
Rohan Bhamre: When are you coming back here
Rohan Bhamre: I want to go for a trip
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw, I had a very Europa Universalist inspired presentation video for my theis. Here's a link:https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=28s&v=awGMT92Sz24
Ambikesh Mishra: No clue. I can't travel because my Visa status is changing
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Is Elon known to take social undertakings like this
Aniket Awasthi: YEs;
Aniket Awasthi: He is very vocal on many issues
Rohan Bhamre: Any interesting issues
Rohan Bhamre: This one is
Aniket Awasthi: Latest follow nahi kya
Aniket Awasthi: Be I have read his tweets on such issues
Aniket Awasthi: SOcial ones
Rohan Bhamre: He is calling for some system where public can rate on journalists credibility
Aniket Awasthi: Elon Musk has been over hyped
Kartik Vermun: Because he's started things which are fucking awesome
Rohan Bhamre: Yes Kartik
Rohan Bhamre: Fight Aniket on this
Kartik Vermun: No one's fighting man
Rohan Bhamre: But do it now
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket this Elon is overrated
Rohan Bhamre: Thinks*
Rohan Bhamre: Change his mind
Kartik Vermun: Okay read his wiki page
Rohan Bhamre: Btw you guys know what's happening in italy
Rohan Bhamre: A right wing coalition won general election
Rohan Bhamre: But the president is not recognizing the result
Satya: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: @918348664817 America sent people to the moon in 1969
Aniket Awasthi: It was fucking awesome; I am not denying it
Aniket Awasthi: But the point is "At what cost?"
Ambikesh Mishra: I didn't know you believed in socialism
Kartik Vermun: Wasn't that motivated by cold war?
Aniket Awasthi: Elon Musk is not delivering on the production. He has taken orders worth millions and is producing about 12000 cars monthly
Aniket Awasthi: That is just 10% of the total production required
Aniket Awasthi: His company is just working on investors money
Aniket Awasthi: There's no revenue cash flow
Kartik Vermun: Yeah tesla in a bad shape
Aniket Awasthi: Abe tesla ka valuation is at 48 billion
Aniket Awasthi: I mean WTF
Aniket Awasthi: It is more than Ford
Kartik Vermun: Valuation can be deceptive
Kartik Vermun: Take snapchat
Aniket Awasthi: He is just burning investors money and investing in research
Aniket Awasthi: But he is not able to earn profits
Aniket Awasthi: He is the master PPT guy
Kartik Vermun: Investing in a whole lot of ventures
Kartik Vermun: No dude he's an engineer
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: MEchanical engineer ?
Kartik Vermun: I mean not by degree obviously
Aniket Awasthi: Abe kya engineering? Usko computer science, rocket science, mechanical, energy engineering sab aati hai?
Aniket Awasthi: He is an entrepreneur who designs stuff
Rohan Bhamre: So he is awesome
Kartik Vermun: Nahi but he's betting big on right areas
Aniket Awasthi: Only space X i guess
Kartik Vermun: And of course building the right team
Aniket Awasthi: Baaki overhyped hai
Rohan Bhamre: And fucking models
Aniket Awasthi: Tesla etc
Kartik Vermun: He started electric cars when no one thought of it
Aniket Awasthi: No, you're wrong
Rohan Bhamre: Bhak bhosdi
Aniket Awasthi: JLR Toyota etc have been working on it since a long time
Aniket Awasthi: Elon musk has yet not delivered on the production
Kartik Vermun: Got in space x privatize space exploration
Aniket Awasthi: He sells the cars at 300k; but do you know for sure that he's making profits at 300k?
Kartik Vermun: Started working on hyperloop to better transportation
Aniket Awasthi: NOt his idea
Kartik Vermun: But he's trying to deliver
Kartik Vermun: I don't know anyone else who is
Aniket Awasthi: Actually Richard Branson is ahead on hyperloop than elon musk
Aniket Awasthi: Elon Musk ka hyper loop is not delivering
Aniket Awasthi: Richard Branson has a working prototype
Aniket Awasthi: not just PPT
Kartik Vermun: Didn't know Richard Branson was involved
Aniket Awasthi: Wohi to bol raha hun
Aniket Awasthi: Don't be a fanboy
Aniket Awasthi: Elon musk is great at PPT and creating Fanboys
Aniket Awasthi: One step ahead of Steve jobs
Kartik Vermun: Solar city open ai boring company
Kartik Vermun: He's bitten more than he can chew
Aniket Awasthi: Steve jobs use to create fanboys using actual products but Elon musk does it via PPT
Aniket Awasthi: Boring company ka tune dekha hai PPT
Aniket Awasthi: Has dega
Aniket Awasthi: @elonmusk frauds, scams, humbugs, and deceptions all in one information-packed thread. https://t.co/yCLGH3ZP4M
Kartik Vermun: Space X 3 consecutive failures, no ppt guy would go for a fourth one
Kartik Vermun: Steve Jobs is called an asshole
Aniket Awasthi: Also, this is so very Tumpian of Musk. https://t.co/MI2Nb0FXdL
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai I think Elon Musk pe bhi movie banegi in the future
Aniket Awasthi: "super strong, incredibly smooth"
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: Ditto Trump
Rohan Bhamre: He is not even a ppt guy then
Aniket Awasthi: Space X is a really good venture
Aniket Awasthi: I would say
Rohan Bhamre: Btw what was the cost of moon landing
Aniket Awasthi: I guess it was about 25-30 billion dollars
Aniket Awasthi: I mean 1970 prices
Rohan Bhamre: Dude maybe it's not always about the money
Aniket Awasthi: $1.00 in 1970 had the same buying power as $6.54 in 2018
Aniket Awasthi: It is; he's an entrepreneur who is taking money from investors
Aniket Awasthi: It is not his money
Kartik Vermun: And?
Rohan Bhamre: Investors are free to invest in him
Rohan Bhamre: Nobody is forcing them
Kartik Vermun: That's what they do
Aniket Awasthi: Investors were free to invest in housing market too in 2008
Aniket Awasthi: But that turned out very well; Nice logic
Aniket Awasthi: And not delivering
Aniket Awasthi: This is very naive to say waise,
Rohan Bhamre: The point is why are they investing in him
Aniket Awasthi: I think it is their sunk cost now
Kartik Vermun: Not saying investors can't be conned, theranos did it brilliantly
Aniket Awasthi: Gale ki haddi, na ugli jaye na nigli jaaye
Aniket Awasthi: He promised more than he can deliver
Kartik Vermun: Yeah bitten more than he can chew
Aniket Awasthi: WOhi to criticise kar raha hun mai
Aniket Awasthi: Steve Jobs etc all delivered
Aniket Awasthi: He is not
Rohan Bhamre: So Elon Musk is a bad investment
Rohan Bhamre: But is he still awesome
Aniket Awasthi: Over priced investment
Aniket Awasthi: No thing is a bad investment
Aniket Awasthi: It is always about price
Rohan Bhamre: There are better investments
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, I mean if you can buy him at a low price then he'll be a good investment
Aniket Awasthi: Abhi he is over priced
Aniket Awasthi: If tesla would have delivered the same using a few billions then it would have been a good investment
Aniket Awasthi: Take an example of DRDO,
Aniket Awasthi: They also deliver stuff
Aniket Awasthi: But you don't call them awesome
Aniket Awasthi: Do you?
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not calling him awesome
Rohan Bhamre: I really don't know enough about him
Aniket Awasthi: Ok, i thought you are
Rohan Bhamre: I'm pushing kartiks side just cuz
Rohan Bhamre: But let's establish this
Rohan Bhamre: Delivering stuff is reliable
Rohan Bhamre: But awesome is being flashy
Rohan Bhamre: Lul
Aniket Awasthi: Agar wo brand ambassador hota ya phir koi actor :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: Lekin wo to entrepreneur hai
Kartik Vermun: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: Mai elon musk ko bura nahi keh raha hun; But I am just calling out blind fanboyism
Aniket Awasthi: Just as people call Rohan Bhakt
Ambikesh Mishra: But doesent being charismatic and flashy gets you more business than being reliable.
Aniket Awasthi: Don't be a fanboy
Aniket Awasthi: Haan yaar, wohi to problem hai aaj kal ke investors ki
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket needs to understand marketing
Rohan Bhamre: Wait are you calling me a bhakt
Rohan Bhamre: Asshe
Rohan Bhamre: Asshole
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Ambikesh Mishra: You can't blame Musk for being pragmatic. More power to him
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: It is as good as saying, you can't blame trump for winning using demagogy
Aniket Awasthi: If you are good with Elon
Aniket Awasthi: selling himself then you should be good with trump selling himself too
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't. I believe in win by any means necessary ideology
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Ambikesh Mishra: In business and professional life I.e
Aniket Awasthi: Ways justify the mean?
Aniket Awasthi: end justify the means*
Kartik Vermun: Each to his own
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes in business they do I think
Aniket Awasthi: Abe Ambi iska bohot bada critique hai
Aniket Awasthi: Kabhi baad me discuss karenge
Rohan Bhamre: I think this ends justifies means and ways justifying means are misnomers
Rohan Bhamre: It's more complicated than that
Aniket Awasthi: @918101459296 tujhe bhi pata hoga; bata dena
Aniket Awasthi: Baad me discuss karte hai?
Ambikesh Mishra: Virtue ethics vs categorical imperative vs goal based ethics
Aniket Awasthi: Haan
Aniket Awasthi: Exactly
Aniket Awasthi: Tujhe pata hi hai
Aniket Awasthi: Then you're making a conscious choice of believing in "ends justify the means"
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. It's better to be successful than virtuous :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: Ab tu anti immigration sentiment Ko prejudice bolega kya
Ambikesh Mishra: Anti immigration sentiment is people being too lazy to compete
Ambikesh Mishra: It is prejudice
Rohan Bhamre: Is it just economical?
Rohan Bhamre: I think it's more social
Rohan Bhamre: I maybe wrong
Rohan Bhamre: But surely it's more that just "foreigners stealing our jobs"
Rohan Bhamre: Anti immigration sentiment trump used was against Mexicans and muslims
Rohan Bhamre: Wo kaha itna job karte h
Rohan Bhamre: Ita Asians and Indians who have jobs
Ambikesh Mishra: No I see it here all the time. American s just want to work 9 to 5. They don't want to have to compete unless they have to which is understandable
Rohan Bhamre: By Asians I mean chinkis
Ambikesh Mishra: They take a lot of these Walmart, subway jobs at absolute minimum wages
Ambikesh Mishra: Chinkis are always at a disadvantage because of English
Rohan Bhamre: But they still have jobs
Rohan Bhamre: And creation of segregated communities definitely has played important role in this hostility
Rohan Bhamre: * segregated ghettos
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: What does it mean? Nehru redrew the Tibetan map? :thinking_face:
Rohan Bhamre: That's such a burn
Aniket Awasthi: Omfg. It's sarcasm
Rohan Bhamre: Lul
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking chambi
Rohan Bhamre: I had read that tweet
Rohan Bhamre: The op said that he wasn't being classist, but just Sharing and appreciating chachas taste
Rohan Bhamre: But I think invoking chachas vocab on his anniversary is irrelevant
Rohan Bhamre: Kinda does sound classist
Arpit Saxena: <Media omitted>
Kartik Vermun: Interesting
Rohan Bhamre: Did you watch so many jp videos that you started hating him
Rohan Bhamre: But @919425052635 I noticed you get aggressive while debating
Aniket Awasthi: Haan. I get aggressive
Aniket Awasthi: I know
Aniket Awasthi: Probably because of Twitter
Aniket Awasthi: Haan be.
Rohan Bhamre: Eb be like. My mind's right but my hearts left
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: That's what I feel too..
Arpit Saxena: Lol
Arpit Saxena: Too many, I've destroyed apoorv's YouTube account

Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mOzNknptlqE
Ambikesh Mishra: I didnt know cobs music was structurally so similar to finish folk music
Aniket Awasthi: This sounds nice
Aniket Awasthi: Where does the cob music belong to?
Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's melodic death metal: heavy guitars and metal chorus-verse structure, melodic harmonic scale guitar leads and synth + laiho singing crappy stiff about death
Rohan Bhamre: They are a finnish band
Rohan Bhamre: Their melodies have always been amazing
Ambikesh Mishra: Have you listened to afterlife by avenged sevenfold? That solo is out of this world
Ambikesh Mishra: I saw them live recently. Was blown away
Ambikesh Mishra: Very cob like in style
Rohan Bhamre: Not yet!
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf. They are such punks
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9jo8UXDVzEE&t=369s
Ambikesh Mishra: This video about it is cool too
Rohan Bhamre: I am digging the fuck out of the verse riff of afterlife, it's actually my favourite part of the song
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah it's catchy as fuck. There's another song of theirs called almost easy with a nice verse
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://amp.businessinsider.com/netflixs-new-comedy-special-nanette-called-radical-and-moving-2018-7
Kartik Vermun: Will watch it sometime
Arpit Saxena: Can anyone recommend good comedy specials on Netflix?
Kartik Vermun: Prime has some good ones also
Arpit Saxena: Kaunse? Specifically?
Kartik Vermun: Zakir khan
Kartik Vermun: Biswa
Kartik Vermun: Kanan gill
Arpit Saxena: Ok
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's a very different presentation of comedy. Plus the conservatives here are going to have a riot with her 'lesbian' content.
Ambikesh Mishra: Guys have you read Sapiens by Harrari?
Ambikesh Mishra: My mind was blown after reading it. Definitely the best book I've read in like 10 years
Satya: Yepp
Satya: Best? :thinking_face:
Ambikesh Mishra: Explained so many things so lucidly
Ambikesh Mishra: And supported my no nation no conflict global world theory :face_with_tongue:
Satya: Han, 1st was really good, 2nd half was kind of predictable
Satya: And boring
Ambikesh Mishra: True
Satya: Unless aliens attack us, not going to happen
Ambikesh Mishra: I also just read it just after Sean Carol's arrow of time book. Interesting parallels with that. I think it's a matter of time. Each imaginary construct has been replaced by a more bigger cooperative one. Religion to nation states to corporations now
Satya: Everytime he had a reason to unite
Satya: Not this time
Satya: Withiut externally conflict, there is not much incentive
Satya: Arrow of time. How is it?
Ambikesh Mishra: There always will be external stimuli. Logic based imaginary constructs replacing dna induced conflicts has been the trend. That's what I got from the book
Satya: What's the focus, science behind it or just history
Ambikesh Mishra: It's really good. Got me really into general relativity and learning the math
Satya: Haha
Ambikesh Mishra: It's a bit part of every major theory in physics right now : relativity, quantum field, string, standard model etc to explain why we.live in such a peculiar entropy condition
Ambikesh Mishra: Very interesting
Ambikesh Mishra: Worth a read
Satya: I'm following it right now
Satya: All speculations, no clear theory :P
Ambikesh Mishra: Do you watch Fermi lab on YouTube?
Satya: I have seen some, not following the channel
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah but educated speculations. Not Arnab goswami level ones :face_with_tongue:
Satya: :squinting_face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: I live with two PhD physicists so that helps.
Ambikesh Mishra: :face_with_tongue:
Satya: Nice
Satya: This message was deleted

Rohan Bhamre: I don't think we need aliens to unite us
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Read half
Rohan Bhamre: These are old one's, but you might like bill burr and aries Spears!
Arpit Saxena: Guys apoorv has been asking me everyday to add me to this group. He reads all the messages anyway. Should we have a vote to add him
Arpit Saxena: I liked Bill Burr. Also Kevin James and Ricky Gervais are good
Arpit Saxena: Btw so many lynchings in Dhule @919422709999
Rohan Bhamre: It happined in a tribal village
Arpit Saxena: Roz aa raha hai
Rohan Bhamre: Are saying there's lynching everyday or the news runs everday
Rohan Bhamre: You*
Arpit Saxena: I assume both
Arpit Saxena: Warna kyun aata
Rohan Bhamre: As far I know only one incident happened
Arpit Saxena: I saw 20 lynchings today
Arpit Saxena: But maybe that happened then only
Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to quote dr Ambedkar
Rohan Bhamre: The VILLAGE
Rohan Bhamre: Unlike some mahatma's beliefs
Rohan Bhamre: Is a cesspool of ignorance and backwardness
Kartik Vermun: Bill burr is pretty cool
Rohan Bhamre: Its pulling India down
Rohan Bhamre: It's not indias strength
Arpit Saxena: Ambedkar said that? Wasnt he a dalit advocate
Rohan Bhamre: Are you saying all Dalits are villagers
Arpit Saxena: Dalit rights*
Rohan Bhamre: You castiest bitch
Arpit Saxena: ?
Arpit Saxena: At that time yes?
Rohan Bhamre: It's a child truth
Rohan Bhamre: *cold
Rohan Bhamre: BR Ambedkar had urged Dalits to quit living in villages and move over to cities. He described that process of migration as new life movement for Dalits. Ambedkars famous quote on villages when he had reasoned, The love of the intellectual Indian for the village community is of course infinite, if not patheticWhat is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism, is valid even today .
Kartik Vermun: Check out hasan Minaj's Netflix special
Kartik Vermun: Speaks about brown racism
Arpit Saxena: He seems annoying, racism shit
Kartik Vermun: Funny though man
Arpit Saxena: But he overdoes it
Arpit Saxena: MATLAB all his jokes are on that
Arpit Saxena: Matlab*
Kartik Vermun: I guess the theme of that special was racism
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Kartik Vermun: I haven't seen his other stuff
Arpit Saxena: He hosted some golden globes or something, usmein bhi
Arpit Saxena: Racism jokes
Kartik Vermun: Maybe awareness speared Kar raha Hai :winking_face_with_tongue:
Arpit Saxena: I just want funny jokes
Kartik Vermun: Bill burr also has themes on various agendas
Kartik Vermun: Feminism specially
Arpit Saxena: Yeah
Kartik Vermun: Just funny to phir zakir khan
Arpit Saxena: Natasha Leggero is a good female comic
Kartik Vermun: Did you see Ali wongs special?
Arpit Saxena: No
Rohan Bhamre: Personally I find stand up with "message"jokes really annoying
Kartik Vermun: Pregnant lady doing stand up
Arpit Saxena: Depends if it's funny or not
Arpit Saxena: Oh yeah dekha hai I think
Rohan Bhamre: Just add Apoorv I don't have his number
Kartik Vermun: Kya phone share Karte ho?
Arpit Saxena: he just opens it...
You added Apoorv Umang
Arpit Saxena: Sup
Apoorv Umang: Sup*
Kartik Vermun: Yo be
Kartik Vermun: Kya tune bhi job chod diya?
Apoorv Umang: Haan
Apoorv Umang: But joining iisc for phd
Kartik Vermun: And Arpit start Kar raha?
Kartik Vermun: :thumbs_up:
Apoorv Umang: Arpit is also a job nibba now
Kartik Vermun: Iisc Kab shuru?
Apoorv Umang: Grey orange robotics
Apoorv Umang: 1aug
Kartik Vermun: Peace
Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar is right. Villages are ignorant cesspools
Aniket Awasthi: But is urban society especially the elite society much different?
Aniket Awasthi: You must have heard about that Delhi golf club incident where they didn't allow a girl from NE India to come in as she was wearing her traditional dress
Aniket Awasthi: Elites are equally dogmatic in my opinion.
Rohan Bhamre: Surely not equally
Aniket Awasthi: Have you seen those people talking to lower class people?
Rohan Bhamre: Citing one case does not establish a trend.
Rohan Bhamre: Tell me where a group of women go out and have fun
Rohan Bhamre: In a city or a village
Aniket Awasthi: I'm not basing my argument on that be.
Rohan Bhamre: Can*
Aniket Awasthi: There are many religious festivals where village women meet
Aniket Awasthi: They have their own music and singing
Aniket Awasthi: They organize meals for each other too
Rohan Bhamre: Can you go out with your girlfriend in a village
Aniket Awasthi: This is very euro centric individualism
Aniket Awasthi: You just shifted the goal post
Rohan Bhamre: So be it
Rohan Bhamre: We have westernised partly alrrady
Rohan Bhamre: It's immensely relevant still
Rohan Bhamre: Why is this bad
Rohan Bhamre: You have a girlfriend I have a girlfriend
Aniket Awasthi: A society much always change and learn new things from other society. West is great and we must learn from it. However you shouldn't copy them blatantly
Rohan Bhamre: That's another matter
Aniket Awasthi: You said it
Aniket Awasthi: So I'm just replying
Aniket Awasthi: The western society is not doing well as a society. Except for USA
Rohan Bhamre: I think they are
Aniket Awasthi: Their TFR is about 1.5
Aniket Awasthi: Hence their population is shrinking.
Rohan Bhamre: There are 1000 parameters to how a society is doing
Aniket Awasthi: Secondly, more than 50%-60% births are out of wedlock in the west
Aniket Awasthi: Their family structure is collapsing
Aniket Awasthi: West was made on the three Fs. Father Family Fraternity
Aniket Awasthi: Father boleto God
Aniket Awasthi: Even USA is doing good mainly because of their central region. Their families are still strong.
Rohan Bhamre: Again, there are 1000 parameters to that. And every parameter has even more angles to look at. The question is simple if you ask a person totally not related to Europe or India , which society you'd rather live in, you know what the answer would be
Aniket Awasthi: Would you be willing to live in india or Uk in 1750?
Rohan Bhamre: Are we living in 1750
Aniket Awasthi: India had better living standards that time
Rohan Bhamre: ..
Aniket Awasthi: A better society too
Aniket Awasthi: This is 2018
Rohan Bhamre: We are getting sidelined
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe take this over a beer next time we meet
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: What do you think was a more prosperous period of India though
Aniket Awasthi: But you're not seeing the coming future
Rohan Bhamre: 1750 or Ashok or gupta
Aniket Awasthi: On relative terms it was gupta Absolute terms it was 1750
Rohan Bhamre: Relative of coursr
Aniket Awasthi: So?
Rohan Bhamre: Curious
Rohan Bhamre: It was on a different note
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: You tell me this
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not sure, India definitely had a higher GDP. But what about GDP per capita and all that. Do you have info on life comparison on the average indian vs the average UK
Aniket Awasthi: Madison project calculated it
Aniket Awasthi: They had comparable Gdp per capita at 1700
Aniket Awasthi: In ppp terms obviously
Aniket Awasthi: But still I'm giving you 1750 as a date as it was the starting of industrial revolution
Rohan Bhamre: I'm more interested in your point
Aniket Awasthi: You answer me first
Rohan Bhamre: I'm really not sure aniket
Aniket Awasthi: It's a choice
Rohan Bhamre: You say per capita GDP was comparable
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: What about war time then
Aniket Awasthi: Aurangzeb was alive in 1700
Rohan Bhamre: War and peace
Aniket Awasthi: UK was going through many revolutions that time too
Aniket Awasthi: Civil War
Aniket Awasthi: Glorious revolution
Aniket Awasthi: Then France ke saath bhi
Aniket Awasthi: So was India
Rohan Bhamre: Sounds very comparable to me
Rohan Bhamre: Not clear cut
Rohan Bhamre: What else can we talk about
Aniket Awasthi: Abe you have to choose
Aniket Awasthi: I would choose to live in UK
Rohan Bhamre: Why
Aniket Awasthi: India had easier life that time though
Aniket Awasthi: UK was growing fast. It had many opportunities
Aniket Awasthi: They were continously reforming the society too
Aniket Awasthi: India was not
Rohan Bhamre: Forgive me if I refrain from making an uneducated choice
Rohan Bhamre: Hmm ok I'd go with you too :grimacing_face:
Aniket Awasthi: It's essentially a choice between present vs future
Aniket Awasthi: Like today I won't choose western society and it's path
Aniket Awasthi: Eastern society like Japan is doing much better
Rohan Bhamre: Today it's clear cut dude
Rohan Bhamre: Yup Japan's doing great
Aniket Awasthi: West was really doing great till 1980s
Aniket Awasthi: Phir unko Pata nahi kya ho gaya
Rohan Bhamre: But we are talking India's position in the world
Rohan Bhamre: I think it's still doing great
Aniket Awasthi: India isn't good
Aniket Awasthi: Nahi.
Aniket Awasthi: It's doing good presently as people who are in working age are from 1970-2000
Aniket Awasthi: Just think what will happen when people who are born today will grow up
Rohan Bhamre: You are specifically talking about liberalism?
Rohan Bhamre: Radical leftism?
Aniket Awasthi: USA needs too many immigrants to work for their technology and science. Their families are not able to provide for such a demand
Aniket Awasthi: I'm talking about the western society in all. On facts and not on any particular ideology
Aniket Awasthi: Matlab half of their PhD are immigrants
Aniket Awasthi: This isn't so for Japan
Rohan Bhamre: So a lot of these PhDs settle there only
Rohan Bhamre: What's wrong in this
Aniket Awasthi: Matlab domestic supply isn't doing good
Aniket Awasthi: It wasn't so before
Aniket Awasthi: Ye recent phenomenon hai
Rohan Bhamre: Does it matter if PhDs come from outside and settle there
Rohan Bhamre: Supply is met
Aniket Awasthi: You can't see the point be
Rohan Bhamre: Tell me
Rohan Bhamre: You can say it's not good for Anglo Saxon preotestonts
Aniket Awasthi: It's about the society which can sustain itself.
Aniket Awasthi: Their model is failing
Aniket Awasthi: As their societies are failing
Rohan Bhamre: I'm still not getting you dude
Rohan Bhamre: Are you meaning this
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: I'm talking about the model on which the society is based on
Rohan Bhamre: Is it bad if it's based on immigration
Aniket Awasthi: West has over done individualism
Aniket Awasthi: You're not seeing the issue
Aniket Awasthi: It's about a balance between society vs individual
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: All such issues are also the dilemma between society vs individual
Aniket Awasthi: West(exclud conservative USA) has become too individualistic
Aniket Awasthi: Which is failing their families
Aniket Awasthi: They can't compromise on their own needs for their family or their children
Aniket Awasthi: Hence this generation of children which are born there isn't very good
Rohan Bhamre: Hasn't a certain ideology promoted this
Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter what ideology it is.
Rohan Bhamre: These conditions the west is facing are certainly a thing they should worry about.
Aniket Awasthi: "Doesn't matter whether it is a black cat or a white cat if it catches the mice "
Rohan Bhamre: But it still seems trivial to me. It's something they can fix
Aniket Awasthi: They are trying since 3 decades now
Aniket Awasthi: They aren't able to fix it
Rohan Bhamre: And they are still at the top
Aniket Awasthi: People are just not having children
Aniket Awasthi: They provide huge tax benefits for families too
Aniket Awasthi: Yet families are just breaking away
Aniket Awasthi: The growth of divorce is still positive
Aniket Awasthi: Free education for children
Rohan Bhamre: These are such first world country problems , it's outrageous
Aniket Awasthi: Child support etc
Aniket Awasthi: But yet people aren't having children
Aniket Awasthi: They have become too individualistic
Aniket Awasthi: How can you change this?
Aniket Awasthi: You when try to westenise yourself and try to learn from them you must be aware what not to learn from them
Rohan Bhamre: In India there is problem of curroption illiteracy education system basic hygiene healthcare poverty pollution women's safety infrastructure
Rohan Bhamre: They have been problems for 7 decades
Aniket Awasthi: Even after 200 years of trying to westenise
Rohan Bhamre: I think the west is better off
Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow Indians suck
Aniket Awasthi: No denying that
Aniket Awasthi: I don't have any hopes from Indians
Rohan Bhamre: :pensive_face:
Aniket Awasthi: But if you are trying to copy the western individualism then it would be even worse
Rohan Bhamre: I wouldn't
Aniket Awasthi: Because what you see today as the western civilization isn't made by people who presently live in it
Aniket Awasthi: It was made by very society oriented people who tried not be very individualistic
Aniket Awasthi: They use to have 3-4 children for the family and the nation
Rohan Bhamre: Haha
Rohan Bhamre: Breed mothafuckas
Rohan Bhamre: For mother rashia
Aniket Awasthi: The three Fs. Father Family Fraternity
Aniket Awasthi: This is their basis
Aniket Awasthi: It's like the present lifestyle that you enjoy is not because of you but because of your father.
Aniket Awasthi: Similarly it's true for the west
Rohan Bhamre: But why do Indians suck
Aniket Awasthi: Because they don't have a scientific mind
Aniket Awasthi: They are dogmatic but not scientific
Rohan Bhamre: It's a shame though. India has a great legacy
Aniket Awasthi: Even you at times just react with emotions than logic
Aniket Awasthi: That India was made by people you absolutely hate today
Rohan Bhamre: Hey tone down with the yous
Aniket Awasthi: Ok.
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf
Aniket Awasthi: Haan be.
Rohan Bhamre: Dude it's like you don't even know me
Aniket Awasthi: Abe you take pride in shivaji
Aniket Awasthi: Right?
Rohan Bhamre: I do
Aniket Awasthi: He was very religious, non individualistic and probably a conservative
Aniket Awasthi: In many terms
Aniket Awasthi: He was a ardent student of his guru ramdas
Rohan Bhamre: I don't hate religious people
Aniket Awasthi: He did many things for the sake of the society
Rohan Bhamre: You are religious aren't you
Aniket Awasthi: He killed Portuguese because Portuguese slaughtered cows
Aniket Awasthi: He detested them for conversions
Rohan Bhamre: Fuck you dude
Rohan Bhamre: Why would I hate anyone in that category
Rohan Bhamre: I have a very specific problem with religion.
Rohan Bhamre: I celebrate all Hindu festivals
Aniket Awasthi: What is it?
Rohan Bhamre: But I don't believe that Krishna was an avatar or Brahma created universe or that Ganesh was actually a person with the head of an elephant
Rohan Bhamre: But I'd still celebrate Ganesh jayanti
Rohan Bhamre: Because I celebrate the moral values these festivals represent
Aniket Awasthi: Why do you think that every person is capable of high thinking or glory?
Aniket Awasthi: Not everyone can be a high thinker
Rohan Bhamre: I dont
Aniket Awasthi: So they need religion
Rohan Bhamre: Yes we specifically spoke about this
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: In the modern era
Rohan Bhamre: The average human may not need these childish stories
Rohan Bhamre: Because if you have a society that believes Jesus was actually born to virgin Mary or that an illiterate warlord merchant said the word of allah
Aniket Awasthi: Abe if you want to look how childish the society is, an instagram page of a wealthy south bombay girl will tell you
Apoorv Umang: I'm so glad I joined this group today
Rohan Bhamre: You create a society of stable but gullible people
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Why
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Apoorv Umang: Pure gold
Rohan Bhamre: All I'm saying is we have the means to be stable without religion today or in the future
Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter what color the cat is if it catches the mice
Aniket Awasthi: You've still not found any good substitute of religion
Aniket Awasthi: Yet
Rohan Bhamre: First of all
Rohan Bhamre: Religion isn't filling any void
Aniket Awasthi: All experiments of eroding or loathing religion has resulted in a very fractured society
Rohan Bhamre: There is no void
Rohan Bhamre: So there's nothing to replace
Aniket Awasthi: Did I send you one passage?
Rohan Bhamre: People previously were not capable of scientific reasoning.
Rohan Bhamre: Today they are

Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Abe wohi to issue hain. Science isn't doing the same thing as the religion does
Rohan Bhamre: You think this a game
Aniket Awasthi: Will science make you go at some strange festival where you don't know anything about who those people are?
Rohan Bhamre: I have texted a year's worth today
Apoorv Umang: Spectator sport
Aniket Awasthi: Ye padhna
Aniket Awasthi: Even ambi would support me here :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Where art thou @18144419636
Rohan Bhamre: I do that already
Aniket Awasthi: But a person who has grown without a religion. Will he also do it?
Rohan Bhamre: I am in a theatre with people o don't know
Rohan Bhamre: I go play badminton with people I don't knwo
Rohan Bhamre: Right now football crazies are doing crazy shit with people they don't know
Aniket Awasthi: You don't interact with people in theaters be!
Aniket Awasthi: Can you relate with all badminton players?
Rohan Bhamre: I don't interact with people in a temple either
Aniket Awasthi: Football can't be a religion be!
Aniket Awasthi: Read this
Aniket Awasthi: Why don't you read this first?
Aniket Awasthi: Uske baad we'll debate
Rohan Bhamre: Okok !
Rohan Bhamre: I will read this
Rohan Bhamre: But let me get this out.
Rohan Bhamre: In the past there was no communication social activities etc etc
Rohan Bhamre: Crowd control inst etc
Rohan Bhamre: Chtuye the log.
Rohan Bhamre: Religion aaya
Rohan Bhamre: Organised society
Rohan Bhamre: Religion became so important
Rohan Bhamre: Hijacked society
Rohan Bhamre: Every advancement in society got claimed by religion
Rohan Bhamre: I have no problem with religion organising society
Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying we can have creed / community not based on childish stories and lies.
Rohan Bhamre: I mean I don't have problem with stories too
Rohan Bhamre: Ramayan Mahabharat are great
Rohan Bhamre: Astronomical literarary and academic value.
Rohan Bhamre: Even the story itself is tasteful.
Aniket Awasthi: BRB
Aniket Awasthi: Will reply to this in sometime
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai iv typed one years worth
Rohan Bhamre: Gn
Aniket Awasthi: Gg*
Apoorv Umang: If you dont message in 5 mins you lose
Apoorv Umang: Last message was anikets so he's winning
Apoorv Umang: Gg lala lost wp boys
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: Took me 15 mins to read through this :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Ambikesh Mishra: Just would say one thing. The 'strong' white families of mid and mid west USA are just as parochial and racist as any backward Indian village
Rohan Bhamre: It's not about just racsim.
Rohan Bhamre: Do you really think they overall as backward and dogmatic as the Indian village family
Rohan Bhamre: I understand indian villagers are not the only dogshit people around.
Rohan Bhamre: But their scale of dogshitness
Rohan Bhamre: In a strict comparison sense
Rohan Bhamre: Is definitely greater
Rohan Bhamre: Of course I don't know other dogshit people like I do indian villages
Rohan Bhamre: I can only guess
Rohan Bhamre: Any stupid fucking shit paranormal activity happens in village
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup. Just replace working on a farm with McDonald's or some local mom and pop shop. Replace lynching with guns. Fanatic rituals with church. You will be surprised. It's just not reported as much in mainstream headlines
Rohan Bhamre: These cucks start worshipping it
Rohan Bhamre: A boy falls ill local priest will say ABC blind faith procedure to cure his illness like pressing hot flat end of blade on the boy
Rohan Bhamre: I have seen drinking cow piss phenomenon but I've heard it happens in North Indian villages
Rohan Bhamre: And don't even get me started on cleanliness
Rohan Bhamre: Filth like there's no tomorrow
Rohan Bhamre: I don't doubt that happens
Rohan Bhamre: Question is how much lynching happens per 100000 people or something
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think that's an equivalent metric. You should compare the lynchings per 10000 to gun related hate crimes per 10000 for a more fairer picture
Rohan Bhamre: Yes however a crime is statistically recorded
Rohan Bhamre: And compared
Aniket Awasthi: Indian villages are relatively less violent than that of mid west USA
Aniket Awasthi: However USA is an abberation because of gun laws. Compare them with villages of Europe
Aniket Awasthi: Western Europe
Aniket Awasthi: USA ke sirf 10% people reside in villages. Shouldn't compare
Aniket Awasthi: Compare the two similar size towns and not villages
Rohan Bhamre: I wasn't talking of violence anyway
Rohan Bhamre: A
Ambikesh Mishra: Also I agree on religion. Science can never replace it. Nature and life events are too random for logic to surpass faith in God.
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Hygiene and health standards is something I would agree on. West does far better
Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's undisputable that living standards in terms of facilities are better. It gets murkier and more grey when you start getting into 'quality' of life.
Ambikesh Mishra: Btw, what do you think the 'superhuman' replacement of religion will be?
Aniket Awasthi: Asking me
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: I don't know
Aniket Awasthi: As far as I've seen the society. Religion has no replacement
Aniket Awasthi: From China to Kazakh to Russia
Aniket Awasthi: All such experiments have failed
Rohan Bhamre: There hasn't been any institution in society that was as powerful as religion
Rohan Bhamre: It's unique
Ambikesh Mishra: Nation states?
Rohan Bhamre: They always had state religion
Aniket Awasthi: Nation states are very fragile. They come and go
Rohan Bhamre: Nation states had deep roots in religion
Rohan Bhamre: Like ABC is a nation of xyz Christians
Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking useless human DNA is too fragile too handle truth
Rohan Bhamre: The god truth?
Ambikesh Mishra: No religon exists because biologically we are afraid of random probablistic events and rules of nature hence seek comfort and peace of mind in the imaginary idea of something protecting us
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Called Dhule?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I grew up in South Bombay. Lost all connections to the wealthy girls there :/
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Welcome to the rant club :D
Aniket Awasthi: Get those back
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tongue:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Am presently 80kgs. Now is not the time :P
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sapiens?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Money
Aniket Awasthi: Institution kahan hai wo
Rohan Bhamre: Dhule is a district place. In it is Dhule city from where I come from. But God knows how many villages are there in dhule
Rohan Bhamre: This particular lynching incident happened in some Banjara tribal village I didn't even know existed
Rohan Bhamre: In the district, that is
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Everyone is part of the institution of money
Aniket Awasthi: So abstract.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: If you'd consider the Church to be the institution of Catholicism, then banks might be considered the institution for money. But whereas the church caters to Christians only, money caters to all.
Aniket Awasthi: Can't disagree
Kartik Vermun: Money bigger than religion then
Rohan Bhamre: Guys hyper bypartisan animosity is destroying civic discourse. so much hate
Rohan Bhamre: It's literally pure unadulterated hatred for the political opponents by dangerous proportion of people.
Rohan Bhamre: Seeing it in the whole world
Rohan Bhamre: I guess I should stop reading Twitter
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or news for that matter
Aniket Awasthi: It's not a good place for discussion
Kartik Vermun: Majority of daily news is useless gossip and speculations
Kartik Vermun: People trying to create perceptions rather than delivering unbiased unopinionated content
Kartik Vermun: Btw did anyone see sacred games
Kartik Vermun: Lack of censorship allowed anurag kashyap to take a dig at congress
Kartik Vermun: Among other things
Kartik Vermun: pretty awesome
Aniket Awasthi: Abe you know. There was one study by one anthropologist in USA that talked about blacks having disproportionately higher crime rate, abuse rate, disease rate and so on. That study was highly criticized on being "racist" and was shouted down
Aniket Awasthi: Such is a level of scientific discourse now in humanities. That guy from Google was removed for his "sexist" comment. He wasn't even given a fair chance to prove himself
Rohan Bhamre: Dude why are you formatting your text in WhatsApp
Rohan Bhamre: Professional much
Aniket Awasthi: Nahi to
Rohan Bhamre: I mean paragraphs
Rohan Bhamre: :grimacing_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Ooh
Rohan Bhamre: It's good
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah, you were saying
Aniket Awasthi: India me Phir bhi there are studies on castes, ethnicities etc which are not shouted down. Even though there are some no go areas like reservations, rural area romanticism which one can't really condemn. But he USA wagera me they are overdoing liberalism
Ambikesh Mishra: I saw an explanation for that in Sapiens. Blacks have have been discriminated against for centuries so that stat makes sense according to that book.
Aniket Awasthi: Point Wo nahi hai. Point is that such studies are now called "racist".
Ambikesh Mishra: USA is a weird place. It is superficially very liberal and people are superficially very nice.
Kartik Vermun: It's build on a copp
Kartik Vermun: *corporate culture
Ambikesh Mishra: That's part of the superficial culture. prevailing now.
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. But why's it in academia?
Aniket Awasthi: Wo Google wala case. What's your opinion on it?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. I think that's exactly it. This weird.liberalism allows such companies to function by people being superficially nice and tolerant. Academia sort of gives the intellectual basis for such a culture to develop
Kartik Vermun: Sundar pichai saving googles image
Ambikesh Mishra: Google has a social image to keep. As.long it convinces women people it is liberal it's good for business.
Aniket Awasthi: Right
Ambikesh Mishra: And lots of women would believe that's what Google real ideology is I guess
Ambikesh Mishra: It's like using sex equality as a conodity
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Sex equality is sacred now. Unquestionable.
Kartik Vermun: Business first always when talking about industry
Aniket Awasthi: True
Ambikesh Mishra: I bet 50 years from now, the current 'liberal' society would be seen as very oppressive and unimaginable to live in.
Kartik Vermun: Superficially nice is still okay although a bit annoying at times
Aniket Awasthi: Abe just a digression. Kartik Twitter par faltu anti Elon musk ek group hai
Aniket Awasthi: They criticize him a lot. I found one criticism very funny. I'll share it
Aniket Awasthi: He said it not me! :grinning_face_with_sweat: Cave rescuer slams Elon Musk's submarine idea, says "He can stick his submarine where it hurts,wouldn't have made the first 50m, Just a PR stunt" -CNN $TSLA (Repost for twitter video h/t @TezzlaCFO) https://t.co/GHWiILrPq5
Rohan Bhamre: I didn't even follow the Thai cave story
Ambikesh Mishra: Funnily enough no one considers economic inequality as a similar concern to gender one which is the fad now in Western society. How is being poor and being denied opportunity any different from being a woman and being denied an opportunity?
Kartik Vermun: Some footballers and a coach trapped in a cave
Rohan Bhamre: I am aware of the outcome
Rohan Bhamre: This incident reminds me of that indian kid falling in a well or something
Aniket Awasthi: Because gender inequality affects middle class and upper class women
Rohan Bhamre: Long back
Rohan Bhamre: Overnight star he had become
Ambikesh Mishra: That's another Western media fetish. The heroic rescue of poor Asians somewhere
Rohan Bhamre: Haha
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Seriously
Kartik Vermun: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: :thumbs_up:
Rohan Bhamre: This is the bigotry of low expectations
Aniket Awasthi: @917891947877 ek aur golden topic chal raha hai. You can lurk
Kartik Vermun: I'm sure he is along with @917407650530
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Not yet
Rohan Bhamre: Interesting evidence
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Honestly companies have realised that adopting as non-controversial stance as possible is the best in an environment with polarized opinions.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Second that. Blacks have higher crime rates. Period. Beating about the bush on that will never help solve the problem.
Kartik Vermun: Survival and diplomacy
Aniket Awasthi: Abe if you look at history. The whole western civilization, it's growth and glory had a base on scientific method of research. Companies can do whatever they want but the science was protected especially from 18th century onwards
Ambikesh Mishra: I know but it's not just about a company stance. I can live without the fakest good morning with a beaming smile on.the street. It happened so much when I was in Grad school
Ambikesh Mishra: That doesn't happen in India at all
Rohan Bhamre: It's a similar scenario with refugees in sweden
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Kartik Vermun: Fake smiles are okay, fake people without skills building fake products angers me
Aniket Awasthi: BTW just flagging that refugees in Sweden are alhumdulliah people. And rohan mentioned them
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Call them by their proper name you Islamophob
Rohan Bhamre: E
Aniket Awasthi: Middle Eastern humans
Rohan Bhamre: Oohhh fiery
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I can feel the fury
Ambikesh Mishra: That's what the hot girls do all the time. :face_with_tongue:

Kartik Vermun: I always cite theranos and Elizabeth Holmes as a golden example
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's a good one.!
Kartik Vermun: And Kickstarter pe people raise money for bullshit products
Ambikesh Mishra: I always use this video as an example
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=txBfhpm1jI0
Ambikesh Mishra: This girl made this when she was 16
Kartik Vermun: Seems like u don't need to build a genuine thing to get money, just grand promises
Ambikesh Mishra: That's what I learnt from Sapiens. You just need to convince people something is good. Objective benefits/qualities don't really matter or are secondary
Ambikesh Mishra: Kitna bhi intellectually evoll e lat Jaye, dna is is still of a chimp :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: *evolve
Aniket Awasthi: Abe ambi don't get too much moved by that book. It's pop anthropology.
Kartik Vermun: I'll read it sometime man
Ambikesh Mishra: I know. I can get that from the random and often ludicrous analogies he uses. But in between there are some really compelling poinys
Aniket Awasthi: I agree. Just don't be biased, that's what I was warning
Ambikesh Mishra: Their veracity I can't judge without reading much more in though
Aniket Awasthi: Wo at the end of the day pop anthropology hi hai. Not a detailed book
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes true
Aniket Awasthi: Like you would remember how people are moved by micro economics 1 and 2. Later on they realize the nuances
Ambikesh Mishra: I see but it at least gets people more interested to delve deeper. I managed to learn about Dna sequences and biology after that
Ambikesh Mishra: As a follow-up
Ambikesh Mishra: But on that note higher PPP or GDP = higher quality of life is a myth and a very Western centric notion
Aniket Awasthi: They have many such indices now; green gdp, happiness index, HDI, SPI
Rohan Bhamre: I'm a simple man
Rohan Bhamre: Boobs=like
Ambikesh Mishra: That's like every girl I had in my class in school or see on the beach. I.dont even notice it now
Rohan Bhamre: :pensive_face:
Ambikesh Mishra: Somehow it's a requirement to be hot
Rohan Bhamre: I can definitely see why
Aniket Awasthi: What was the point of the video? that she was stripping off?
Rohan Bhamre: Video seemed fine
Rohan Bhamre: Not unlike Avril Lavigne Ambi listens to
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Nothing other than that normal people have to work 7 days a week to win stuff but girls can accomplish that with a big smile and some boobs and then cry about inequality
Ambikesh Mishra: Haha
Ambikesh Mishra: Emo music has always been my guilty pleasure.
Ambikesh Mishra: I can't justify it logically. It's the DNA of a chimp acting up
Aniket Awasthi: This is a very parochial way of thinking. It is similar to compare your job with a whore and complaining that you earn less than her. It is also about the job profile and also about the size of the market. Like how many such girls are there who can be so popular with lower effort effort? Secondly, after 10-15 years of your job, you will be better positioned than most of such video girls.
Apoorv Umang: Nice. I'll join the discussion soon let me formulate my thoughts
Aniket Awasthi: Prelims cleared
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: G fucking g
Rohan Bhamre: Wanted to post gif
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Kartik Vermun: Congrats man
Aniket Awasthi: Upsc civil service
Apoorv Umang: Congratulations!

Kartik Vermun: Stock price gir gaya iske baad :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Good time to buy
Rohan Bhamre: Why did he call him a pedo
Aniket Awasthi: Because he's a British expat living in Thailand
Aniket Awasthi: Stereotype
Aniket Awasthi: Thailand me they settle for girls she males etc
Rohan Bhamre: How did he not expect backlash
Rohan Bhamre: I guess it's very easy to slip up in this page culture
Rohan Bhamre: Outrage*
Aniket Awasthi: https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/1018583452063600641?s=21
Aniket Awasthi: Look how his cult members are defending him
Rohan Bhamre: I don't doubt it
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: "You don't become Elon by being normal. You become Elon by being extremely obsessive. "
Rohan Bhamre: You really must hate Elon musk
Aniket Awasthi: I don't
Aniket Awasthi: I just don't like blind following
Aniket Awasthi: Fan clubs
Aniket Awasthi: Nobody is beyond the scope of criticism
Rohan Bhamre: Apoorv
Aniket Awasthi: His fans and Modi fans or unreasonable liberals are the same.
Rohan Bhamre: We shouldn't let the fringe sideline us
Aniket Awasthi: Even liberals know that you're not the fringe. They just overhype it to silence you
Aniket Awasthi: The debate is never reasonable it mainly dialectic
Rohan Bhamre: Do you know about that Sushma Swaraj controversy
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Sadly liberals aren't fringe they are mainstream
Rohan Bhamre: So she recieved a lot of hateful comments on that
Aniket Awasthi: She took a wrong decision.
Aniket Awasthi: Based on emotive response and not facts or procedures
Rohan Bhamre: Are you sure?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: There was address discrepancy. As they were married so they should usually have same address
Aniket Awasthi: They also didn't have same last names
Aniket Awasthi: That guy was just following the norms
Rohan Bhamre: So my point is
Rohan Bhamre: After getting hateful comments she proceeded to like the most hateful ones
Rohan Bhamre: Like and retweet
Rohan Bhamre: Then she tweeted that you should be civil and all
Rohan Bhamre: That's fine
Rohan Bhamre: But there were even more people who respectfully asked about the fiasco
Rohan Bhamre: To them she gave no reply
Rohan Bhamre: Classic example of getting sidelined by the fringe
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Issues always get hijacked like this
Aniket Awasthi: I guess you're not seeing the bigger picture
Rohan Bhamre: Which picture
Aniket Awasthi: You think that Twitter is a place for reasonable discussion which is wrong. It's a place of rhetoric and not any discussion.
Rohan Bhamre: It is clearly not
Rohan Bhamre: Twitter kya. I don't see any discussion anywhere
Aniket Awasthi: Liberals will always use the actions of "fringe" and associate it with you
Aniket Awasthi: And the rw does the same with liberals
Rohan Bhamre: That's why I absolutely despise late night shows
Rohan Bhamre: It's not about comedy at all is just a sick excuse to cheer your own rhetoric
Aniket Awasthi: There's a research on this
Aniket Awasthi: I read it and person actually made a nodal graph of how people discuss topics
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: They just talk with each other and bitch about the other group
Aniket Awasthi: They never discuss it with the other group
Rohan Bhamre: Are we doing the same?:grimacing_face:
Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to think we don't
Aniket Awasthi: In this group I don't think so
Aniket Awasthi: Actually only Shubhayan and I are right wingers here. :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Wow shubhayan?
Rohan Bhamre: He fits the liberal stereotype perfectly
Aniket Awasthi: Joke tha
Rohan Bhamre: Pata h yaar
Rohan Bhamre: :pensive_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Phir ye kyu Bola.!
Rohan Bhamre: But seriously. Bengali, glasses, plays fusion, reads non fiction. Typical eminent intellectual
Aniket Awasthi: Bhadralok
Aniket Awasthi: There's a word for it
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhadralok
Rohan Bhamre: He is reading it but not saying anything
Aniket Awasthi: He must be asleep abhi to.
Rohan Bhamre: Hmm
Aniket Awasthi: Satya is reading

Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm far-left socially, mid-right economically.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Somewhat libertarian
Shubhayan Ghoshal: "While the bhadralok were influenced by the West (in terms of their morals, dress, and eating habits) they were also the people who reacted most strongly against the West, and the most scathing critiques as well as the most spirited defences of Westernisation were made by bhadralok writers."
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Raja ram mohan Roy was a prominent one
Apoorv Umang: The fuck does this mean? Please speak english
Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Yuss
Ambikesh Mishra: Is welfare economics considered right wing?
Aniket Awasthi: In modern times no economist can challenge welfare
Aniket Awasthi: But the only difference they have is about the degree of redistribution and secondly how to re distribute
Aniket Awasthi: Neo con people talk about direct benefits transfer or conditional cash transfer
Aniket Awasthi: Liberals like more state involvement in education health and so on
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Education and health are not supposed to be as expensive as they are in US. Insurance players and health companies have learnt that the health insurance collusion makes much more money than a free markets. College education could easily be more expensive if public schools were out.
Aniket Awasthi: USA has failed in health
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know people there don't go to the doctor unless they get critical. Because by law if someone is admitted in emergency then they can't be liable for paying for emergency operations
Aniket Awasthi: American spend twice as much as European on medical sector. Yet their health outcomes are worse than that of Europe Japan and south Korea Excluding research and development.
Aniket Awasthi: Actually American education is expensive because of their visa norms. Companies in USA can't directly hire people from developing world. It's very difficult as quota is less. So people have to get into universities just as a way to get work visa
Aniket Awasthi: Wto me GATS agreement Agar sign ho jayega to I guess most of the masters courses in universities will just dry up immediately
Shubhayan Ghoshal: That's news to me
Aniket Awasthi: What is?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: GATs agreement
Shubhayan Ghoshal: If so you're quite right
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Master's just for education's sake will not be quite as appeasing
Rohan Bhamre: Aman ki asha
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: What a shit show
Rohan Bhamre: Whole session was tu tu me me
Aniket Awasthi: Bad stroke
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Cooperation ki asha
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Aniket, what's your take on gun control, climate change and same-sex marriage?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/282333/
Shubhayan Ghoshal: We should all be vigilant against a single story The danger of a single story https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story
Aniket Awasthi: Gun control is essential if the state is weak and society is armed. Example states like in Europe need stringent gun laws. Homosexuality is a natrual phenomenon although it's not normal. Marriage seems to be fine however they shouldn't be allowed to adopt children as we don't have enough scientific evidence on psychology of children. Climate change :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. This is called sensationalism
Aniket Awasthi: What are your views? @14043680303
Rohan Bhamre: Have we spoken about homosexuality, cause that's exactly what I think
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: Although I slightly doubt that homosexuality is not healthy
Rohan Bhamre: Personal health
Aniket Awasthi: Haan, gaand marne ke liye nahi hoti hai
Aniket Awasthi: They have disproportionate share of HIV AIDS
Aniket Awasthi: and other STI
Rohan Bhamre: And not just physical health. It must have some psychological ramifications cucumber obviously your social growth is drastically different
Aniket Awasthi: Also, homosexual marriage doesn't include Public Display of love and cockfests. Public decency must be maintained.
Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea how the cucumber came to be in the sentence
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: Don't call it cucumber; call it organic dildo
Rohan Bhamre: That's just some low life hipster shit
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, confine it to the bedroom
Rohan Bhamre: What about this though
Rohan Bhamre: Does homosexuality have any adverse psychological effects?
Aniket Awasthi: There are no good and conclusive psychological studies on it yet
Aniket Awasthi: So we can't say
Rohan Bhamre: I doubt we can ever have an honest scientific study on it
Aniket Awasthi: The major issue is the how would you design an experiment?
Rohan Bhamre: Given it it such a politicised issue
Aniket Awasthi: I think, it is also a problem of design of experiments
Aniket Awasthi: Matlab; first it is very difficult to create a control group. Secondly, it is difficult to design the indices that we want to measure
Aniket Awasthi: Psychological health matlab exactly kya ?
Aniket Awasthi: Gays have a fully functioning analytical brain.
Rohan Bhamre: We know that
Rohan Bhamre: I'm guessing sexual orientation changes your behaviour with the opposite sex. And social interactions with the opposite sex plays an important role in social and psychological development of a person.
Aniket Awasthi: Hmmm
Aniket Awasthi: But wohi hai fir baat ki what qualifies as psychological health
Rohan Bhamre: No idea
Aniket Awasthi: You can create your own metric of measurement which others can deny
Kartik Vermun: A lot of homosexuals will object you calling it not normal
Aniket Awasthi: It will become very subjective
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai homosexuality chod
Rohan Bhamre: Talk transgender
Rohan Bhamre: That's actually crazy shit
Kartik Vermun: Are they hijras?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Kartik Vermun: Or male in a female body and vice versa
Kartik Vermun: Seems confusing at times
Rohan Bhamre: People cutting off healthy body parts, injecting hormones while all their body cells still having the original sex chromosome
Rohan Bhamre: Still have*
Kartik Vermun: Torture man
Rohan Bhamre: Best example of politicisation of minorities
Aniket Awasthi: Don't confuse gender and sexuality
Rohan Bhamre: How in the world is this advocated as a healthy procedure
Rohan Bhamre: What do mean
Rohan Bhamre: I know the distinction
Kartik Vermun: Care to elaborate @919425052635
Aniket Awasthi: Sarcasm
Rohan Bhamre: Okay
Rohan Bhamre: It's the most unscientific bullshit
Aniket Awasthi: This is now the modern narrative. Where sex and sexuality are mutually exclusive. https://www.wattpad.com/341462536-complete-list-of-genders-the-complete-list-of-all/page/3
Rohan Bhamre: It's cruel
Aniket Awasthi: Actually, I have a very compelling argument against homosexuality in public. I as an individual have my personal right to liberty. This includes my right to reputation. If homosexuality with public display of love is normalised in the society. It would be very easy for someone to think of me as gay even if I am hanging out with any male friend of mine in public. If someone thinks of me as gay I would feel it as an infringement of my right to reputation and liberty.
Aniket Awasthi: Hence, public display of love for homos must be outlawed.
Rohan Bhamre: Can you say that someone thinking of you as gay is a defamation?
Rohan Bhamre: *defamation
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: *is defamation
Aniket Awasthi: He is calling me a gandu essentially
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: Legal bodies won't appreciate that remark!
Rohan Bhamre: So what about climate change
Aniket Awasthi: What about it?
Rohan Bhamre: You laughed at it
Aniket Awasthi: No comments on it
Aniket Awasthi: American right wing says that it is not anthropogenic
Aniket Awasthi: THis is as good as flat earth propaganda
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4OlWYAXc6Y
Rohan Bhamre: remember this scene in avengers?
Rohan Bhamre: this is the westerner story of calcutta
Rohan Bhamre: forget calcutta i dont know any place in india that looks like that. its downright humiliating.
Kartik Vermun: Ambi getting emo on insta

Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: Also looking for a good history book on colonialization to debunk a lot of the historical absolutism I read in Sapiens
Ambikesh Mishra: +Instagram is linked to Tinder so it requires a different strategic approach
Kartik Vermun: How's your success on Tinder been like
Kartik Vermun: I stopped months ago
Aniket Awasthi: Colonization by European powers?
Ambikesh Mishra: It's better here. I have managed a date two weekends in a row now. I
Aniket Awasthi: Desi ya videshi?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. The disease & distance argument vs. the Europeans being more inquisitive than rest of the world narrative
Ambikesh Mishra: One Mexican, one American
Ambikesh Mishra: Though the Mexican I met on a trek not on Tinder
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: What do you really imply by "date"?
Ambikesh Mishra: Spend the day at the beach/ bike somewhere and go for lunch
Ambikesh Mishra: respectively
Kartik Vermun: What's your idea of a date?
Aniket Awasthi: 1/2nd base minimum
Ambikesh Mishra: I can't risk deportation for a sexual assault case :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Kartik Vermun: Can't expect on first date
Aniket Awasthi: Kyu nahi be? With consent
Ambikesh Mishra: How's the scene in Bangalore? I see Aditya Pathak as a big try hard on Instagram
Aniket Awasthi: Yussss
Kartik Vermun: Who's he?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes if I was a white ripped fuckboi then maybe. I have to play a different game due to handicaps
Kartik Vermun: Bangalore tinder had no luck, stopped altogether
Ambikesh Mishra: A mining guy from our Azad.You should check out his Instagram for entertainment
Kartik Vermun: Lol
Ambikesh Mishra: It was the same in Penn State. No one would reply. I had given up there. Lazy people just wanted to stay inside in snow
Kartik Vermun: I did go on a date though
Kartik Vermun: And she paid, I insisted on going Dutch
Ambikesh Mishra: Wow that would be a keeper. I always met kind of weird ones. Except one who had a cool Startup
Aniket Awasthi: Wo Singapore wali?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I have met a total of 5 girls from Tinder in 4 years :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Mai 4 se
Ambikesh Mishra: Surprisingly my American physicist housemate has a similar success rate despite him being a member of fraternity. I wonder who actually is successful on it
Aniket Awasthi: Top 5-10%
Aniket Awasthi: Only
Ambikesh Mishra: 5-10% as in success rate in date conversations?
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: I meant 5% men get maximum matches
Kartik Vermun: Recently someone met a murdered on Tinder
Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJoN_I9ebQ
Ambikesh Mishra: Have you guys heard of these Eluvite rip-offs?
Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/zmrpiCsuv6w
Ambikesh Mishra: Who is this guy Jordan Peterson?
Kartik Vermun: Canadian professor
Kartik Vermun: Was in news for his recent interview
Kartik Vermun: Not the one the above video talks about
Ambikesh Mishra: I see. Just saw his Wikipedia about political correctness. Sounds interesting, I'll look up some of his beliefa
Kartik Vermun: I saw his pod cast with Joe Rogan
Kartik Vermun: Talks some interesting stuff about pure carnivore diet
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It gets worse too, remember this one in Slumdog: https://youtu.be/oIrehaK5Jks
Rohan Bhamre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd6FgYbMffk
Rohan Bhamre: False cause fallacy.
Rohan Bhamre: how is hinduism credited for bharathnatyam kathak
Rohan Bhamre: why wont you credit indic people's love for art form
Rohan Bhamre: hinduism was important in society hence was the medium of our cultural pursuits
Rohan Bhamre: most of our
Rohan Bhamre: @919425052635
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's good to know what's holding you back :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: is 'how to burn' taught in the bhadralok academy
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Many kids around the world have bigger problems than same-sex parents so adoption should not be ruled out. Yeah gun control is important in lawless states, but what about regimes like Syria and alternatively, if the state is strong in a functioning democracy?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Bhadralok Academy teaches a variety of courses including intellectual hair parting and optimally large eyewear. Burning is an elective.
Rohan Bhamre: classic
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Any other details? Was there a second?
Ambikesh Mishra: How's the scene in Atlanta?
Ambikesh Mishra: And you should definitely come visit here sometime whenever you get some time!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/world/asia/india-jayant-sinha-lynch-mob.html
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah! Likewise :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Not too sure on the Tinder front but I guess there's less charm for desis.
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket do you know why this guy garlanded these convicts?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Because it's a lot easier to gain votes by dividing folks and showing that you can connect with the masses. And you can also make friends with the BJP top brass by demonstrating you identify with them.
Aniket Awasthi: You know there are 3 million manual scavengers in india even today
Aniket Awasthi: Recently 30 or 13 people died in Delhi while cleaning up a sewage pipe
Shubhayan Ghoshal: While it's one story, it's not the only story of India.
Aniket Awasthi: Syria is a weak state. A despotic state isn't a strong state. Strong state means in which laws are followed by will of citizen or by force of state.
Aniket Awasthi: I told you 3 million is the number
Aniket Awasthi: Every Gali has a manual scavenger. Every village even till date has manual cleaners
Ambikesh Mishra: Awesome I'll plan something soon. Haven't been to those parts at all yet
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It might be a higher estimate.
Aniket Awasthi: I didn't follow that story.
Aniket Awasthi: Actually it's a government estimate. So it's a pessimistic estimate
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rights-toilets/clean-india-mission-not-ending-manual-scavenging-activists-say-idUSKBN1CW1YF
Aniket Awasthi: You know these bhangi, mehtar, mahar, jatav, balmiki etc
Aniket Awasthi: These are castes involved in this activity
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Govt estimates peg it at .75 million though that seems low.
Aniket Awasthi: No
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: Socio economic caste census of 2011 is the government data
Aniket Awasthi: This is just underestimation by ias babus to meet their target
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://scroll.in/article/841580/government-claims-to-have-assisted-91-of-indias-manual-scavengers-without-counting-93-of-them
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Probably
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But 3 million is a lot
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm not saying it may not be true, but it's a lot
Shubhayan Ghoshal: UP, Kashmir and Bengal seem to be the worst offenders
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yep! Atlanta's got some decent spots :)
Shubhayan Ghoshal: World of Coke, and a huge aqaurium
Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>

Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Nty. Scroll. Wire. Quint
Aniket Awasthi: They are into yellow journalism
Aniket Awasthi: Sensationalism
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But that's what Jayant Sinha wanted. I'd never heard of him before and now he's on the radar. Same as Yogi, same as Varun Gandhi.
Aniket Awasthi: Tune Wo poora incident padha hai?
Ambikesh Mishra: Looks amazing!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
Rohan Bhamre: Where to even read about this
Aniket Awasthi: Wire and opindia padh lo
Rohan Bhamre: All reports will be riddled with confirmation bias from both sides
Aniket Awasthi: https://youtu.be/VAFRmkGiivA
Aniket Awasthi: That's why read both
Aniket Awasthi: Centrist unbiased reporting is an oxymoron

Aniket Awasthi: I'll take it
Rohan Bhamre: politicalcompass.org
Rohan Bhamre: I didn't find the questions impressive
Rohan Bhamre: But the sight seems to be popular
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Your Political Compass Economic Left/Right: 2.63 Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: 4.62
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: I thought questions would be of political ambiguity
Rohan Bhamre: Not straight up factual
Aniket Awasthi: It is an old test
Aniket Awasthi: It is eurocentric too
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi ko liberterian left kaun bol sakta hai matlab
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi was a conservative
Rohan Bhamre: Hipsters who rant against capitalism while sipping their Starbucks who sell naked pics online
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Compared to his times, he supported multiple minorities, religions coming together.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Libertarians are pro-capitalism
Rohan Bhamre: I didn't say libertarians
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Erm, so well Gandhi's supporters are hippies
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or at least those you think he was left
Shubhayan Ghoshal: And you wonder why left and right don't find a dialogue
Rohan Bhamre: When did I say Gandhi supporters are hipsters
Rohan Bhamre: In popular culture hipsters are people with annoying traits of over enthusiastic progressivism
Rohan Bhamre: They are not "the" left
Rohan Bhamre: I think the point where the left and right don't have a dialogue is when someone "straw man"s the other.
Rohan Bhamre: Like this
Rohan Bhamre: And this
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Libertarians are pro-capitalism by definition
Shubhayan Ghoshal: And this
Rohan Bhamre: It's not straw man ing if I am not misrepresenting you
Rohan Bhamre: Your argument
Rohan Bhamre: *
Rohan Bhamre: And again. I was not talking about libertarians
Rohan Bhamre: It was really a light hearted comment about the hipsters people usually like to bitch about.
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Kinda like this one
Rohan Bhamre: Please don't destroy me
Shubhayan Ghoshal: "Queen of Nuance" :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Should certainly ask her if Gandhi was left.
Aniket Awasthi: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan is right
Aniket Awasthi: That's like a republican having a inter faith lunch with yahoodis
Aniket Awasthi: It was mainly politics
Rohan Bhamre: As in political right?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/07/liberal-gandhi/
Rohan Bhamre: Where are you on the compass
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I think Khilafat movement and fasting for peace during lunch were, while inevitably political, more in line with his actual belief system.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: *partition; not lunch
Shubhayan Ghoshal: No one fasts during lunchtime
Rohan Bhamre: Glad you straightened that out!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/07/liberal-gandhi/
Shubhayan Ghoshal: And the alternative right view
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/308550/
Aniket Awasthi: You should read ambedkar on gandhi
Aniket Awasthi: He rips him apart and his level of politics
Aniket Awasthi: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_FNSQcEx02A
Aniket Awasthi: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/swarajyamag.com/amp/story/ideas%252Fdismantling-sainthood-ambedkar-on-gandhi Some pretext
Aniket Awasthi: Khilafat movement :face_with_tears_of_joy:. The greatest blunder it was. It was an opportunistic act! Arun Shourie wrote about gandhi and Ali brothers. They had a very transactional relationship. Ali brothers after Khilafat were proponents of partition
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi believed in castes
Aniket Awasthi: He had a distinct view of religion in politics. He didn't separate them
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: My friend sent this to me. @14043680303
Rohan Bhamre: Kya message h isme
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The individual, while important, does not rise above the collective.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Extremely stinging.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Need to read more about Ambedkar
Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar according to me saw the reality clearly
Aniket Awasthi: However his solutions were not pragmatic
Shubhayan Ghoshal: He called a spade a spade
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: That's not always the best idea if you want to rise to the top in politics, but you always need the folks who do, esp when writing the Constitution.
Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar writing the constitution is a hyperbole. He was the chairman of the drafting committee. It doesn't mean that he did all the wori. BN Rau was I thinking very instrumental in most of the conatitional aspects
Aniket Awasthi: Constitutional aspects *
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah that's certainly true. Although you give the 'direction'. And are accountable.
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Was just mentioning as people usually don't see this aspect
Aniket Awasthi: But I really like ambedkar but not his ways
Aniket Awasthi: You should also read savarkar
Shubhayan Ghoshal: He's got PhDs from Columbia and LSE
Shubhayan Ghoshal: He did write a book where he supported the partition. That is supposed to have caused a significant impact.
Aniket Awasthi: He called out islamism too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/staying-in-school-genetics/565832/
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yes he was opposed to discrimination.
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: This is what we call "virodhabhasi lekh"
Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're trying hard
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The p value would have been more interesting
Shubhayan Ghoshal: ??
Aniket Awasthi: Someone said There are there are different levels of lies. First comes an ordinary lie, then comes political lies then comes statistics.
Aniket Awasthi: Counterintuitive
Rohan Bhamre: He lost most elections
Rohan Bhamre: Gandhi won all elections
Rohan Bhamre: Gandhi was a good politician
Aniket Awasthi: "Lies, damned lies, and statistics":face_with_tears_of_joy:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The term was popularised in United States by Mark Twain (among others), who attributed it to the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."
Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're still saying that genetics is now more indicative than wealth for staying in school
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: This quote
Aniket Awasthi: I've not read mark Twain. Have you?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn yes
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Exactly. But there are folks on the extreme political right who had popular appeal too. Including Bose.
Aniket Awasthi: Bose was extreme left
Aniket Awasthi: Wo to logo ko comrade bolta tha comrade Shubhayan
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Political right i.e. fascist tendencies
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Social left
Aniket Awasthi: Haan
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: But he was definitely smarter than Nehru ji
Aniket Awasthi: And more courageous
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Courage does not good leadership imply
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know he actually won the elections in the haripura session of congress
Aniket Awasthi: But Nehru complained to Gandhi. Gandhi ji became gussa and took it as prestige issue. Nehru ji played internal politics and ousted him using Gandhiji's support.
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhiji resorted to extra-electoral instruments like political blackmailing. It is like when kids playing cricket say 'bat mera hai, mai out ho gaya to mai bat le kar jaa raha hun'
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah, it was over the involvement of Indian troops in World War 2
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Gandhi surprisingly supported it, Bose was opposed
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Gandhiji was a good politician
Shubhayan Ghoshal: For what it's worth, Gandhi didn't seek any political office
Aniket Awasthi: Hmmm
Shubhayan Ghoshal: He was committed to freedom of India
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The means will always be debatable
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Whether through peace or violence
Aniket Awasthi: Hindsight is 20-20
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Black Swan theory disagrees
Aniket Awasthi: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: What the second best vision?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: That it's easy to give a false rationalization post the occurrence of a rare event
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I don't see Nehru in the typical narrative. Mostly about Sitaramaya as a candidate for Gandhi.
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: This has to be satire

Arpit Saxena: Unashamedly
Rohan Bhamre: Go Arpit
Rohan Bhamre: Get a beautiful girl
Arpit Saxena: Not in Bangalore
Rohan Bhamre: It's on Sunday
Rohan Bhamre: Go there dude

Apoorv Umang: 10k dede
Rohan Bhamre: bhosdike youll get beautiful girls
Rohan Bhamre: why should i pay
Apoorv Umang: Arpit dega fir
Arpit Saxena: Why is no-one talking about successful rich entrepreneurial girls?
Apoorv Umang: Same reason they are not asking for hot guys
Arpit Saxena: Woh bhi milengi
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Market principles. Less demand.
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: Did u make that right now
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Apoorv Umang: Lol
Arpit Saxena: What does it mean?
Arpit Saxena: Kuchh statistics bhi daal
Aniket Awasthi: Bc tujhe ye Sab ek hi larki me chaiye!
Aniket Awasthi: Tu daal de
Arpit Saxena: Makes you think, are they detached from today's reality or is it us?
Apoorv Umang: nigga wat
Rohan Bhamre: its not that they dont want successful rich entrepreneurial girls. its probably because they are too rare
Rohan Bhamre: arpit be trippin
Arpit Saxena: I meant the tone of the ad, the ideology behind it
Arpit Saxena: Did they not know the backlash they would get
Arpit Saxena: Or is it just assuming that there will be a backlash
Arpit Saxena: Us assuming*
Arpit Saxena: Who is more detached from reality
Rohan Bhamre: they probably have a loyal clientele and dont a care much of public perception
Arpit Saxena: Then why put it the duking hindu
Arpit Saxena: Fucking*
Rohan Bhamre: so that interested people get on
Rohan Bhamre: its a matrimony service
Apoorv Umang: I think in indian arranged marriages boy has to be rich and girl pretty
Rohan Bhamre: thats the essence of it
Arpit Saxena: I mean, u dont have dowry ads in newspapers even though that still happens
Arpit Saxena: Isn't this almost as bad
Apoorv Umang: Why do you think this is bad vaise?
Arpit Saxena: Atleast from a political point of view
Arpit Saxena: Politically correct*
Rohan Bhamre: rich guys wanting beautiful girls is a personal preference
Rohan Bhamre: dowry is illegal
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Rohan Bhamre: what is the comparison dude
Arpit Saxena: Ok
Arpit Saxena: Maybe not
Arpit Saxena: Matlab objectification of women is still there
Arpit Saxena: That's almost a crime today
Apoorv Umang: If you consider men and women equal, this is probably morally wrong
Apoorv Umang: So do you?
Rohan Bhamre: equivocation fallacy
Rohan Bhamre: the phrase men and women are equal
Rohan Bhamre: if it means that men and women deserve equal respect and opportunities then i dont find anything wrong here
Rohan Bhamre: you may question the taste
Arpit Saxena: What about objectification in that ad then
Arpit Saxena: Is that equal respect?
Arpit Saxena: They obviously don't care about successful women
Rohan Bhamre: its really unfortunate that people having preference for beautiful girls make you feel that its objectification
Arpit Saxena: I meant diff treatment of a ilities based on sex
Arpit Saxena: Abilities*
Arpit Saxena: I understand how it makes sense, just wondering
Rohan Bhamre: see what i think of objectification is
Rohan Bhamre: the term is so memed out
Rohan Bhamre: they conflate everything with objectification
Rohan Bhamre: zz too much to write
Rohan Bhamre: ok so sexes are diffierent
Rohan Bhamre: hence treatment can be different
Arpit Saxena: Youv have time
Rohan Bhamre: they prefer beautiful women
Rohan Bhamre: its just that simple
Apoorv Umang: Personally, i think for a woman being pretty > being rich, opposite for men. This is how it is in society, and how i and maybe you also feel. Question is, is this right or wrong?
Arpit Saxena: For marriage
Apoorv Umang: Haan ofc
Arpit Saxena: Yeah, why does it sound sexist then
Arpit Saxena: If it was an ad for blind women and deaf men you wouldn't call that sexist
Rohan Bhamre: outrage culture has distorted your vision
Apoorv Umang: Lol
Shubhayan Ghoshal: What about intelligent, understanding women > hot, golddiggin women?
Apoorv Umang: No
Arpit Saxena: I think it's the implied power structure that sounds sexist
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well that answers it
Arpit Saxena: Answers what?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: This
Arpit Saxena: ?
Rohan Bhamre: YOU ARE NOT MAKING SENSE
Apoorv Umang: You have to add ugly also shubhayan
Apoorv Umang: To intelligent vala
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Suppose we add 'plain-lookin'
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Erm what was confusing?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: About this?
Apoorv Umang: Ugly mein kya problem hai?
Arpit Saxena: We thought it answered the question of sexism-or-not
Arpit Saxena: I thought*
Rohan Bhamre: well i personally cant help but feel annoyed when i see a hot girl marry an ungly guy
Arpit Saxena: U will feel annoyed when any hot girl gets married :p
Rohan Bhamre: but i dont think i should bring any morality angle to it if both of them consent
Apoorv Umang: How does ugly, intelligent and understanding compare to hot, dumb, gold digging for you?
Rohan Bhamre: that would be arrogant
Arpit Saxena: That's the point, it still sounds wrong
Arpit Saxena: Or atleast something you're supposed to be disappointed in
Rohan Bhamre: yes because of outrage culture im suspecting
Arpit Saxena: Even you are annoyed by it
Rohan Bhamre: yes
Aniket Awasthi: You all are talking about patriarchal attitude of society. Will any rich, powerful and intelligent girl marry a hot, poor and dumb guy?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Arpit Saxena: No, but we will applaud her if she does I guess
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I can handle a lifetime of understanding and intelligent but not a lifetime of dumb and gold diggin
Arpit Saxena: Why judge anyone if they are consenting
Rohan Bhamre: why?
Rohan Bhamre: stop with this pretentious moral high ground please
Arpit Saxena: Dunno, but we won't judge her
Arpit Saxena: The same way
Aniket Awasthi: Why not? Some actions are right or wrong in absolute terms.
Arpit Saxena: Why is marrying a rich guy wrong
Arpit Saxena: What high ground? Just telling you how I would react, and most people too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Same reason why we go for a high-paying job that we hate
Aniket Awasthi: I don't say whether it is wrong or right. I am saying that we can judge.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: We sell ourselves
Rohan Bhamre: your kids will be ugly XD
Arpit Saxena: Yes, but almost all of us would judge it to be wrong
Shubhayan Ghoshal: 10 toes does for me
Rohan Bhamre: your kids will be ugly XD
Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan needs grey matter
Rohan Bhamre: we can judge objective choice
Rohan Bhamre: but we cannot judge morally
Apoorv Umang: I think we need a girl if we actually want to debate preferences
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But if we can score and intelligent, understanding and hot woman, then well....
Apoorv Umang: Lao koi ladki
Shubhayan Ghoshal: *an
Aniket Awasthi: No, this is a false argument.
Arpit Saxena: Essence of every conversation in this group
Aniket Awasthi: Men can talk about women issues too if men are knowledgable.
Rohan Bhamre: no uterus no opinion boyyo!
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Hahaha :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Arpit Saxena: Of course they can, just hard to remove bias
Aniket Awasthi: At the end it is about knowledge and not the person who is talking about it
Apoorv Umang: Kaise false bhai, how do you know a pretty girl likes or does not like ugly rich guys?
Arpit Saxena: You can't just call yourself 'unhiased'
Rohan Bhamre: its impossible to remove bias
Arpit Saxena: Yes, which is why diversity is required...
Shubhayan Ghoshal: If she divorces him after 2 years and keeps the money
Aniket Awasthi: They do like rich, ugly and powerful men.
Apoorv Umang: U dont know
Aniket Awasthi: I know; many of my female friends are like that
Apoorv Umang: 2nd hand knowledge
Aniket Awasthi: They call themselves 'sapiosexual'
Aniket Awasthi: 90% of knowledge is 2nd hand be
Shubhayan Ghoshal: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Apoorv Umang: Not preferences, they aare first hand
Apoorv Umang: Vaise meri uber trip khatam thx guys
Aniket Awasthi: Is par actually ek economics par noble price mila tha Samuelson ko
Arpit Saxena: Still stuck in bus for another hour lol
Aniket Awasthi: Isi argument par; which you are saying
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Aniket Awasthi: So he proved that preference can be revealed of an individual.
Rohan Bhamre: the point is guys
Aniket Awasthi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference
Rohan Bhamre: calling this phenomena sexist and objectification is purely outrage culture moral high ground preacher trash
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Half an hour
Rohan Bhamre: its preferences arising from free will of individuals
Arpit Saxena: Why does arranged marriage of bimbo/entrepreneur sound worse than arranged marriage of 2 doctors
Aniket Awasthi: lol; there's really no free will
Arpit Saxena: Stfu with it buzzwords, just trying to figure out our reactions here
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I've heard this one before
Rohan Bhamre: bhai bhavna samjh le omg dont go philosohical on this one
Aniket Awasthi: ok
Rohan Bhamre: holy shit aniket just went friedrich nietzsche on me
Aniket Awasthi: nahi be
Rohan Bhamre: which community has best arranged marriage girls
Rohan Bhamre: gujarati?
Aniket Awasthi: Which context?
Rohan Bhamre: hot girls ofcourse
Rohan Bhamre: itsnt it established that guys prefer beauty
Aniket Awasthi: Money, dowry, looks, character?
Aniket Awasthi: Sindhi, punjabi, pahadi brahmins, have the best looking girls.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Indori. Hands down.
Rohan Bhamre: never imagined id be accused of using buzzwords
Rohan Bhamre: i guess you are right
Rohan Bhamre: but in my defence they are not entirely meaningless
Arpit Saxena: Maybe, but it's only noise in this discussion
Arpit Saxena: Doesn't add anything meaningful
Arpit Saxena: Also the former atleast has sexual attraction to begin with
Arpit Saxena: Rest of the process is probably identical for any arranged marriage
Rohan Bhamre: one sided
Arpit Saxena: Not according to aniket
Aniket Awasthi: Didn't get you
Arpit Saxena: Sapiosexyal?
Rohan Bhamre: you said somehing about sapio
Rohan Bhamre: fuck
Arpit Saxena: Doesn't that imply sexual attraction
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, some people are attracted towards intelligence
Arpit Saxena: Wohi
Arpit Saxena: Not one sided then
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: I think, rohan is very much objective about looks and effect of looks on sexual attraction. Are you @919422709999 ?
Arpit Saxena: Isn't everyone
Arpit Saxena: Or was that sarcasm
Rohan Bhamre: yes but i ESPECIALLLY am :D
Aniket Awasthi: Most of the men are but not all
Arpit Saxena: What?
Aniket Awasthi: Most of the men pay disproportionate attention towards looks but not all men do that
Aniket Awasthi: brb
Rohan Bhamre: nooooooooo
Arpit Saxena: 5% :battery: gn guys
Rohan Bhamre: i have noticed
Rohan Bhamre: is arpit more interested in talking about gender issues
Rohan Bhamre: i remember our time in manali he was more passionate in discussing gender issues
Arpit Saxena: I stay away from all political issues
Arpit Saxena: Including this
Arpit Saxena: Dunno how I got into it
Rohan Bhamre: but this isnt political
Arpit Saxena: Well u get what I mean
Rohan Bhamre: then wtf do you even talk about you fucking robot
Arpit Saxena: Normal stuff?
Arpit Saxena: Books/movies/video games?
Arpit Saxena: I'm sure you'll be that dadaji who keeps talking about the state of politics all the time
Shubhayan Ghoshal: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: burned
Rohan Bhamre: shit i gotta keep my robophobia in check guys
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Guys consider talking about girls normal stuff
Arpit Saxena: Yes, but not gender differences and shit
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Except when Nietchism is used
Rohan Bhamre: you're the one to talk when a gender issue got you talking in the group
Arpit Saxena: I just said I don't know how I got into this
Rohan Bhamre: wtf
Arpit Saxena: Maybe cuz I'm bored in a bus for 2 hours
Rohan Bhamre: its irrelevant cuz you did!
Rohan Bhamre: ok ok fine
Arpit Saxena: It's not the first gender issue brought up here I'm sure
Arpit Saxena: I mean I'm still curious about it but these discussions go nowhere
Rohan Bhamre: when do you think the discussion goes somehwere?
Rohan Bhamre: when someone agrees with you?
Arpit Saxena: I mean gender discussions always devolve into the same things
Aniket Awasthi: I do agree and concede if I was wrong
Arpit Saxena: Nothing productive comes out of it
Arpit Saxena: It's repetitive
Aniket Awasthi: In short run
Aniket Awasthi: It's more about food for thought
Aniket Awasthi: Which in long run can influence your thought process
Arpit Saxena: Always the same food
Aniket Awasthi: Is it?
Aniket Awasthi: Think again
Rohan Bhamre: i think you are being cynical arpit
Arpit Saxena: Why
Aniket Awasthi: On arpits defense there's a definite need to raise the quality of discourse
Aniket Awasthi: But the quality of discussion here is good
Aniket Awasthi: Mainly due to diverse opinions
Arpit Saxena: Not that diverse
Arpit Saxena: It's not even about that
Aniket Awasthi: I disagree
Aniket Awasthi: I've even mentioned that you're wrong. Things aren't repetitive
Aniket Awasthi: Gave you an example too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://youtu.be/n5h0qHwNrHk
Rohan Bhamre: The opening scene reminded me of the service Arpit and gang were trying to develop
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Which was that?
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: *you do
Rohan Bhamre: Lauren southern btw
Rohan Bhamre: I guess he will explain
Ambikesh Mishra: She's average looking :face_with_tongue:
Rohan Bhamre: If this is the average looking blonde girl
Rohan Bhamre: What the fuck am I doing in India
Rohan Bhamre: Fuck this shit I'm out
Rohan Bhamre: I'm coming for an MBA even if I don't need or want one
Ambikesh Mishra: I think San Diego is the place to be. That place is full of pretty sights.
Ambikesh Mishra: Hot girls + sick music scene + paradise weather
Ambikesh Mishra: Don't go to Harvard and shit. If you go to a nice tier 2 or 3 State University you'll get at least 5 better than that in your class.
Rohan Bhamre: Why are blondes so disproportionately hot
Rohan Bhamre: Make up and workout culture?
Arpit Saxena: Wow good morning
Arpit Saxena: Itni jaldi uttha hai rohn
Rohan Bhamre: Gtfo dude we aren't talking your normal size stuff
Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think they are. Brunettes are equally. Yes. They do a lot of biking, hiking, gym etc
Rohan Bhamre: *normal stuff
Rohan Bhamre: By blondes I really mean whites. Sorry for the misnomer
Ambikesh Mishra: It goes for men too. White men and women have just better features. Lighter skin and eyes + nealry 70 percent kids start hitting the gym from high school.
Ambikesh Mishra: It is also part of the bullying culture at least in the US. High school is an incredibly rough social space
Ambikesh Mishra: You have to look a certain way minimum to pass through unscathed
Ambikesh Mishra: Growing up is also very outdoorsy and athletic for kids. Both parents usually work meaning kids go for camping, swimming trekking most of summer
Ambikesh Mishra: I taught first year undergrad for a whole year. Got to know so much about their culture. It's a whole different ball game which plays a huge part in fitness during adult life
Rohan Bhamre: so you think lighter skin is more attractive
Rohan Bhamre: racist!
Rohan Bhamre: just kidding
Apoorv Umang: What about childhood obesity? Suna hai bahut bacchey mote bhi hote hain
Aniket Awasthi: About 15-20 percent hai as far as I read about it
Kartik Vermun: I was childhood obese
Aniket Awasthi: This is obesity and not overweight
Kartik Vermun: Hmm
Kartik Vermun: Fair point
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: So about 35-40% obese and overweight
Rohan Bhamre: Stuck in traffic again Apoorva?
Apoorv Umang: No but vela hoon
Apoorv Umang: And its fucking apoorv
Rohan Bhamre: Sorry man this shit autocorrected you into Apoorva
Shubhayan Ghoshal: If you say someone is average looking you're mean... Wait, they're mean.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nobody needs or wants one
Aniket Awasthi: White women are mean?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Statistically speaking
Aniket Awasthi: Is it related to race or people who are born and brought up there are in general mean?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Average=Mean
Aniket Awasthi: Ya Al-uuuh. Tauba tauba
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Though average can actually refer to any measure of central tendency

Aniket Awasthi: They also have women reservation in tickets distribution
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: Just SC St reservation
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: Then why is this guy is being shown as the first non muslim elected in assembly
Rohan Bhamre: General seat
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: Recent history
Rohan Bhamre: Women reservation also
Aniket Awasthi: Not in parliament and vidhan sabha
Aniket Awasthi: Just in local bodies
Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't matter right if it's a reserved seat?
Aniket Awasthi: I think they have reservations for tickets
Aniket Awasthi: Not for seats

Ambikesh Mishra: Guys I've been reading a lot of history the past few weeks (John Keay, Romila Thapar). I think I'm leaning towards the Congress ideology of secularism. :face_with_tears_of_joy: Do you think the Aryan invasion theory (whether partially or completely true) in any way relevant in establishing identity today?
Aniket Awasthi: Aryan invasion/migration is true
Aniket Awasthi: However the evidences which RT presents are very controversial. Recently there's a genetic study of mitochondrial dna and normal dna
Aniket Awasthi: Which proved that there are 3 main groups in india
Aniket Awasthi: Onge Indus valley Steppe
Ambikesh Mishra: So Harappans are Dravidian if the chronolgy of the invasions is to make sense?
Aniket Awasthi: No
Ambikesh Mishra: Oh okay. What are Onge and steppe?
Aniket Awasthi: This is wrong
Aniket Awasthi: Onge is negroid race
Ambikesh Mishra: Migrated from sub-sahran Africa?
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: So what are Industry valley people then? Their script wasn't Sanskrit so they predated Aryans for sure
Aniket Awasthi: Right now don't bring philology into the discussion. Philological evidences are weak to prove much. Genetic evidences are stronger
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay. It's just so confusing to make sense of the chronolgy.
Aniket Awasthi: There were two main categories Ancestrally north Indians Ancestrally south Indian
Ambikesh Mishra: This is cool. I'm pretty Aryan :face_with_tongue:
Aniket Awasthi: These are formed by admixture of these three
Aniket Awasthi: Nothing to be proud about Waise
Ambikesh Mishra: No just a trivia fact
Aniket Awasthi: Ok. Got it wrong
Aniket Awasthi: The box are the first settlers of India
Aniket Awasthi: Aasi = onge genes
Ambikesh Mishra: Which was all over India or south/north predominant?
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Now if you infer from this. The society today is highly mixed
Aniket Awasthi: Across the castes structure
Aniket Awasthi: Every caste will have a variety of gene pools
Aniket Awasthi: Obviously there will be exceptions mainly due to geography
Ambikesh Mishra: So no one is Aryan/Dravidian and their genetics are highly mixed if I understood it correctly?
Aniket Awasthi: In general yes.
Aniket Awasthi: However there are significant differences
Aniket Awasthi: Upper castes tend to have more of steppe genes
Ambikesh Mishra: Do we know the origin of the onge i.e how they migrated to the subcontinent?
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay this makes a lot more sense than the philological chronology I read with John Keay for placement of historical perioda
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: They walked
Ambikesh Mishra: But not from the Steppes?
Aniket Awasthi: From Africa
Aniket Awasthi: Currently we haven't found any human fossil older than what we have found in Ethiopia
Ambikesh Mishra: Isn't it the same route then as the Aryans from the Himalayan passes?
Ambikesh Mishra: Just at a different time maybe
Aniket Awasthi: Recently there's a news of Chinese human older than this but it's still under debate. So Africa is the cradle of human specie
Aniket Awasthi: Aryans are steppe people
Ambikesh Mishra: Homo erectus?
Aniket Awasthi: Not exactly. Aryan is actually a term used for a linguistic community which spoke proto sanskrit. That's why in genetic study people use steppe rather than aryan
Aniket Awasthi: To remain exact
Aniket Awasthi: Homo sapiens
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes but the migration of both into India( steppe and onge) is from the Himalayan passes correct?
Aniket Awasthi: Himalayan nahi. It's from Hindu kush
Aniket Awasthi: Khyber pass
Aniket Awasthi: And also from Iran
Aniket Awasthi: Directly
Aniket Awasthi: But don't read too much of romilla thapar
Aniket Awasthi: She's a sloppy historian
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. Sorry I don't know they were separate ranges. I learnt something!
Aniket Awasthi: She's an indologist who can't understand sanskrit
Ambikesh Mishra: No I've just been reading Keay. Just read an arcticle from her
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: But dravida itself is a wrong group
Aniket Awasthi: If you speak in normal terms. Aasi people are the original inhabitants of India
Aniket Awasthi: Indus valley people are from Iran
Aniket Awasthi: They migrated to sindh and punjab from Iran
Aniket Awasthi: Now, there was a drought like condition about 4000 years back ( this is the start of what we call "meghalayan age"). So ivc people had to shift southward
Aniket Awasthi: At the same time steppe people also migrated
Ambikesh Mishra: So the language Sanskrit was eventually an assmilation of all 3 in varying amounts?
Aniket Awasthi: So dravida (red) are a mixture of ivc + onge
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay nice.
Aniket Awasthi: Can't say. But most probably sanskrit is independent
Aniket Awasthi: Similarly north Indians = steppe + indus valley
Aniket Awasthi: So the indus valley is found all throughout India
Ambikesh Mishra: Not enough preserved ancient text to construct a philological chronology?
Aniket Awasthi: Rig ved is the oldest written text
Ambikesh Mishra: It's interesting that their city planning didn't carry through as they migrated
Aniket Awasthi: But as these are "shruti" texts. They were transmitted via voice. They were passed on through generations and it was very later on when they were actually written
Aniket Awasthi: That's because of meghalayan age
Aniket Awasthi: There were severe drought like conditions around 4000 years ago throughout the world
Aniket Awasthi: Most of the urban centers vanished
Aniket Awasthi: Mostly the rural population would have migrated as they would have been tougher than the urban population
Ambikesh Mishra: I see. That makes a lot of sense. Essentially we don't know much about the period when this Meghalayan draught started to when the Rig Veda was written to know how language evolved in between?
Ambikesh Mishra: Symbols to written texts i.e since permanent settlements weren't the norm and nomadic people were predominant?
Ambikesh Mishra: While the draught was prevalent
Aniket Awasthi: Indus valley script hasn't been decipherd yet
Aniket Awasthi: So we can't say
Ambikesh Mishra: I know but I read certain articles its symbols being more similar to some South Indian scripts than sanskrit
Aniket Awasthi: But answering the core question. Yes, there was aryan migration to India
Aniket Awasthi: Scripts and languages shouldn't be confused Waise
Aniket Awasthi: Conspiracy theories. Iv script ke baare me kuch nahi Pata hai. Literally
Ambikesh Mishra: I meant the nagari lipi not Sanskrit I.e
Aniket Awasthi: Nagri lipi is very recent
Aniket Awasthi: 1200 years max
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay. I find a lot of historical revisionism mixed with jingoism from Desi authora
Aniket Awasthi: Earliest script we know is bhrami script
Ambikesh Mishra: Trying to construct modern identity from sketchy historical narratives rather than telling facts. Someone like Romila Thapar
Ambikesh Mishra: I see
Aniket Awasthi: Haan. Marxist ideology hai
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways. Thanks! I learnt a lot and clarified a lot of things
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Some people say this
Aniket Awasthi: Script and language shouldn't be confused. Ye Mai Hindi Roman script me bhi likh sakta hun. Isse language change nahi hoti hai
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that's a very nice chart too . I hadn't seen it
Rohan Bhamre: Race cannot be isolated. Especially in a place like India
Rohan Bhamre: Good "thread"
Ambikesh Mishra: Another interesting observation as I read further into the Mauryan period is that Buddhism and Jainism were not 'religons' in the modern notion of the word but rather more like a code of behaviour and a way to live life as shown by some successful people. Very different from Islam and Christianity. Is that a correct interpretation?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. No eastern religion can be compared with Islam or Christianity
Aniket Awasthi: But they were religions as a whole. They had their own meta physics, rules, priests, vihars and temples
Ambikesh Mishra: I see.
Aniket Awasthi: After ashoka, bhuddism had a major text called abhidham pitka which were philosophy and rules to be followed
Aniket Awasthi: Ashoka used it to make societal laws and he use to enforce those laws using bureaucracy and religious police
Aniket Awasthi: Dhamma mahaamatya they were called
Aniket Awasthi: Laws were very intrusive too. Like ban on Bali of animals, promotion of duty towards parents, validity of religious police and state policy of proselytization
Rohan Bhamre: Academically it's known that Dharm and religion do not have interchangeable meanings
Rohan Bhamre: Speaking of Buddhism. Can you imagine that modern day Afghanistan once had a dominant presence of Buddhism
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I read about that. I suppose they were made to tie the huge empire into a cohesive one but didn't last long after ashoka
Ambikesh Mishra: Dharms literal meaning is duty right not religion?
Ambikesh Mishra: The religion one seems to be a more westerns interpretation of it
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Rohan Bhamre: I am absolutely astonished to see the number of such posts on this subreddit
Rohan Bhamre: Kids having financial conflicts with their parents
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: I come across atleast one post a day like this
Rohan Bhamre: Has parenting taken an ugly turn in the West
Aniket Awasthi: Such scenarios are seen in India too
Aniket Awasthi: It is very common
Aniket Awasthi: You can't judge a society on the basis of a few incidences
Rohan Bhamre: It's not
Rohan Bhamre: I kind of check though subreddit daily
Rohan Bhamre: Pretty common posts
Aniket Awasthi: Reddit again is a very non reliable source
Rohan Bhamre: Not upvoted much though
Aniket Awasthi: Plus only motivated people join
Rohan Bhamre: Acha
Aniket Awasthi: Western parenting is still fine; at least in whites
Aniket Awasthi: Blacks have been known not to be good parents. They leave their wife/girlfriends when she has a baby
Rohan Bhamre: That's known to the point of being joked about
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Apoorv Umang: @919422709999 would you help your dad pay bills in this situation?

Apoorv Umang: I would probably loan him, definitely not give for free
Shubhayan Ghoshal: If he's living in the same apartment, and earning, well.. you gotta pay your share of the bills.
Ambikesh Mishra: It seems the guy in the post already has made his decision the way he described his parents lifestyle. I bet there is more to the story.

Aniket Awasthi: Hogwash
Aniket Awasthi: He says Allah's Islam is what should be followed
Aniket Awasthi: And not mullah's Islam
Aniket Awasthi: So he wants to follow just quran
Aniket Awasthi: And reject all other hadis and other texts
Aniket Awasthi: But quran in itself is very sectarian and divisive
Rohan Bhamre: Unless he is taqqiyaing us
Rohan Bhamre: His attitude is pretty secular and humanitarian
Aniket Awasthi: But it's better than others I'll say
Aniket Awasthi: One step at a time
Rohan Bhamre: Guys
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Right-wing fringe hollers out the center. While the centre remains apologetic supporters.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-brief-history-of-the-rupee/article24739411.ece
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Didn't know this
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah it's pretty amazing to think of the sources where they are keeping and retrieving all this information.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braj_Kumar_Nehru
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._B._Hedgewar
Aniket Awasthi: What about him?
Aniket Awasthi: I know these two
Shubhayan Ghoshal: RSS stayed aloof from independence movement. Now claims the spoils, including Patel.
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Do they claim patel?
Aniket Awasthi: Or do they claim independence?
Aniket Awasthi: BJP does that, Rss doesn't
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah reread history, Patel had banned the RSS
Aniket Awasthi: ok
Rohan Bhamre: Afaik RSS stayed away from politics till 1960s
Rohan Bhamre: I don't suppose that should stop them from participating in independence struggle because independence was a more than a political movement
Rohan Bhamre: But then apart from Congress no organisation took part in freedom struggle
Rohan Bhamre: I may be wrong
Rohan Bhamre: Which brings us back to the same point.
Rohan Bhamre: Indians were not nearly as enthusiastic about independence as our textbooks would have us claim
Rohan Bhamre: But apart from RSS duties the sanghis did participate in their personal capacity towards independence
Rohan Bhamre: What people don't see is that RSS was founded in 1920s. When the freedom struggle intensified they were still small.
Aniket Awasthi: This seems to be their official stance; but they weren't apolitical.
Aniket Awasthi: I think shubhayan has confused participating in Quit India movement with independence struggle. Am I wrong? Also Quit India Movement was a disaster, nothing came out of it. The british were shaken by the mutiny by RIN and also by army.
Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea why shubhayan shared Kumar nehru
Rohan Bhamre: Am I missing something?
Aniket Awasthi: He represented India in the 'Sterlings balances' negotiations with Britain at the post-Second World War reparations conference.[12]
Rohan Bhamre: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: Sorry I am an economics noob
Rohan Bhamre: Sterling balances just going over my head
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai please I don't think the acronym rin should be assumed to be known by others here
Aniket Awasthi: Royal Indian Navy
Aniket Awasthi: Aree matlab Indian and European banks had a lot of liabilities of each other.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Even Civil Disobedience
Aniket Awasthi: English use to change the exchange rate at their own convenience.
Aniket Awasthi: Jaise they devalued Rupee wrt PS, and they were able to reduce their liability by 100mn PS

Arpit Saxena: Lots of teams doing it now
Ambikesh Mishra: Any link?
Aniket Awasthi: Exactly
Aniket Awasthi: Also ai was doing one unique thing. They were portraying aggressive even though their abilities were in cd
Aniket Awasthi: Humans backed off a lot of times because of this bluff
Rohan Bhamre: I was hoping for metas to develop from this
Rohan Bhamre: So far I only see salve tactic
Rohan Bhamre: Any other meta practices by bots?
Rohan Bhamre: Ignored
Rohan Bhamre: I'm gonna get ignored now:pensive_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Nothing very prominent
Aniket Awasthi: But you can count lane cutting too. When bots were running down the creep wave
Apoorv Umang: Sentries to tank tower hits

Ambikesh Mishra: I'll check it out
Arpit Saxena: Og vs eg
Arpit Saxena: What a storyline if that happens
Arpit Saxena: No laptop? How?
Ambikesh Mishra: Now I understand Satyas feelings
Ambikesh Mishra: It broke last year. Then I never replaced it to invest money in Architectural wood models
Arpit Saxena: So just your phone? No pc?
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup. I usually just go to the office in case I need to do anything
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Arpit Saxena: Ghar pe no kaam?
Ambikesh Mishra: Life is so much more productive without it
Ambikesh Mishra: Nope.
Ambikesh Mishra: Other than taking calls
Ambikesh Mishra: I get a shit ton of work calls
Rohan Bhamre: It's like no fap
Rohan Bhamre: No lap
Rohan Bhamre: Good work Ambi proud of you
Ambikesh Mishra: Now I know what you watch on YouTube
Ambikesh Mishra: Though I watched this yesterday so am no better. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KBuJA5EqU9s&t=399s
Ambikesh Mishra: Hey guys! I had a question about corporate law and Vijay Mallyas case with his F1 team. I was wondering if anyone is good at these legal things?
Aniket Awasthi: Tell me
Ambikesh Mishra: So Mallya had shares in Force India(his F1 team). Recently the team went into administration( I think it's the UK term for bankruptcy?) due to money owed to creditors. The team was rescued by a consortium lead by a Brazillian investor. The administrator needed the approval of 13 Indian banks which has a wordwide freeze on Vijay Mallya associated entities. However, it circumvented that by selling Force India's assets. I can't seem to understand how you can't buy the team Force India itself (by buying the shares) but still legally in fact buy it by paying for it's assets? Here's more on the topic: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2018/08/25/f1-on-track-for-legal-battle-next-month-over-force-india-sale/amp/
Aniket Awasthi: So it is a bankruptcy case of a UK based company which is governed by UK laws. Technically, the firm filed for bankruptcy. So this is a matter between the creditors and the prospective buyers. While the promotor of the company is meanwhile free to do administrative tasks. However, the promoter can't do such a task after the resolution/restructuring/liquidation has been processed by the court(here administration).
Aniket Awasthi: Then this case will be tried further under 'wilful defaulter' regime. If UK has such laws. For that the current creditors will have to prove that Promoter of the firm is a wilful defaulter and hence his other assets can be attached in the bankruptcy process.
Ambikesh Mishra: Whats the promoter of the company?
Ambikesh Mishra: Is it the administrator(FRP)?
Aniket Awasthi: Promotor of a company is the person who raised all the funds and is often incharge of the company
Aniket Awasthi: He/she takes the important strategic decisions of the company's functioning
Ambikesh Mishra: So Vijay Mallya in this case right?
Aniket Awasthi: It is comparable to MD/CEO etc however, promotor usually has a lot of stake in the company's ownership too
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: MOst probably
Aniket Awasthi: As he in incharge of the administration of the company
Aniket Awasthi: You can think of the promoter of a company as a person who is the boss of CEO
Aniket Awasthi: Jaise Elon Musk
Aniket Awasthi: Even though he doesn't have a substantial ownership of the company
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that makes sense. But I still don't understand how the court appointed administrator(FRP) needed approval of Indian banks to sell Mallyas shares but could sell the assets of the company without approval. Isn't the value of those shares through the assets? Aren't they the same thing? So Mallya was a wilful defaulter. But now that another investor has legally bought those assets, Indian banks have no way to recover the money through those assets. Isn't that Money laundering? But through the UK court system(administration process)
Aniket Awasthi: I am not privy to the UK's handling of such situations. But I am guessing that UK is one of the most transparent laws in this field as it houses the London Stock Exchange.
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, creditors will have to file a case here against mallya to prove him as wilful defaulter
Aniket Awasthi: BTW, the consortium of banks were not the creditors of the Force India. They became the creditors of force India as Mallya diverted money from Kingfisher to Force India
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's why the administrator s first priority was to the creditors of Force India and not Vijay Mallya
Ambikesh Mishra: But the distinction between shares and assets isn't something very clear to me
Aniket Awasthi: They have a precedence order when it comes to liquidation of assets
Aniket Awasthi: Creditors(preferential share) > Creditors(non preferential share)> outstanding debt owners> outstanding payments and so on
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that makes a lot of sense
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: Shares are the percent of your ownership of the firm. Assets are what firm owns.
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup but I meant in the transfer of ownership. So if an investor buy Force India's shares and now owns that company it has to get approval.(due to it's previous owners liabilities). But if it creates a new firm it can still buy the assets due to the bankruptcy process at play. Sounds like a legal loophole to attain the same objective but with lesser hassles
Aniket Awasthi: NOt a loophole; this is the text book case of fraud.
Aniket Awasthi: Law covers it
Ambikesh Mishra: Okay I think I understand it now.
Ambikesh Mishra: Thanks dude! You are the man!
Aniket Awasthi: Excessive mannerism...
Aniket Awasthi: :P
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah bad habit I have started to acquire here as I talk to consultants and clients here :face_with_tongue:
Aniket Awasthi: Yes; I got that
Aniket Awasthi: Small talks run Corporate culture
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes sadly but very much needed skill unfortunately
Rohan Bhamre: The habit of excessive gratitude expression is insufferable
Rohan Bhamre: All HRs I talk to basically boil down to who says thank you more

Kartik Vermun: Ur welcome
Aniket Awasthi: This guy is like Dawkins
Aniket Awasthi: @919422709999 I went through the talk; I won't agree with him on many topics.
Aniket Awasthi: As I mentioned he is like Dawkins, who I don't find very practical
Rohan Bhamre: You are looking for solution based talk
Rohan Bhamre: He doesn't give a solution. He gives a diagnosis
Rohan Bhamre: In this talk that is
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. This is the reason
Aniket Awasthi: This is the easy part
Rohan Bhamre: It's necessary
Rohan Bhamre: Brb
Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse. But it's easy.
Rohan Bhamre: its a good message, and unfortunately not being said and heard enough in this world. don't dismiss it cuz its easy (i actually dont think its easy) but callinig it easy is not good criticism of this
Rohan Bhamre: criticising your own ideas is hardly talked about in any sphere
Rohan Bhamre: i dont think brieftube is helpful for this video
Rohan Bhamre: i guess brieftube works on strictly lecture based format talks

Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I remember. I read some comments recently about how some people are still in the flat Earth patch while others have now updated to quantum theory one. :face_with_tongue:
Ambikesh Mishra: Though quantum theory is too eerily similar to how games are modeled and have glitches
Rohan Bhamre: I for one am interested to know about the ethical conflicts that would arise usage of simulated reality
Rohan Bhamre: Too bad that's never going to happen
Rohan Bhamre: In my lifetime*
Ambikesh Mishra: Wouldn't it make sense for people with incurable mental illnesses or really old people
Rohan Bhamre: And the ramifications in philosophy
Rohan Bhamre: Oh my
Rohan Bhamre: Hey guys
Rohan Bhamre: I just spoke to the exposed Hindu bigot Jayant Sinha
Rohan Bhamre: He was giving me life advice
Aniket Awasthi: What was it?
Rohan Bhamre: While placing emphasis on reading a lot
Rohan Bhamre: He gave me a list of 10 books to read
Rohan Bhamre: Unsurprisingly the first one in the list was Bhagwat geeta
Rohan Bhamre: What a sanghi
Aniket Awasthi: Have you read BG?
Rohan Bhamre: (being sarcastic)
Aniket Awasthi: BG is nice, if nothing else it is chronological
Rohan Bhamre: I would guess so
Aniket Awasthi: When I read the quran, it was just random.
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: It is not in chronological. So I had to get another edited one which was in chronological order
Rohan Bhamre: Allhamdullillah
Aniket Awasthi: Ye land of seven rivers
Aniket Awasthi: Ye land of seven rivers is kind of amateur work
Aniket Awasthi: Thoda factual issues hain us book me
Rohan Bhamre: Have you read all
Aniket Awasthi: So cross that out; Sanjeev Sanyal wrote that book. He is a finance/economics guy.
Aniket Awasthi: YEs
Aniket Awasthi: Life of Pi nahi
Aniket Awasthi: Rest all I have read it
Aniket Awasthi: Making of Indian Constitution :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: I abhor any document which is produced by lawyers.
Aniket Awasthi: Solely by *
Rohan Bhamre: You know
Aniket Awasthi: https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/sc-construction-ban-in-mp-maharashtra-uttarakhand-will-ruin-real-estate-recovery/article24849306.ece
Aniket Awasthi: Milords
Aniket Awasthi: Solid waste management par; construction hi ban kar diya
Rohan Bhamre: Hiking banned in Uttarakhand
Rohan Bhamre: Rafting banned:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: Ye lawyers logo ka dimag hai aisa; Inhi logo ne Indian constitution likha hai Very sloppy document I would say
Rohan Bhamre: Who will go to Uttarakhand now
Aniket Awasthi: #LawyerDimag
Aniket Awasthi: Our constituent assembly had a majority of lawyers BTW
Aniket Awasthi: Probably Ambedkar was one of the sane voices there as he wasn't really a lawyer
Rohan Bhamre: Guys please don't think of Jayant Sinha as a bigot
Aniket Awasthi: Even today 60-70% of the cabinet is made of lawyers
Aniket Awasthi: Chinese Communist Party has 80% engineers at the top
Rohan Bhamre: This guy is MBA from Harvard
Rohan Bhamre: I know academical accolades do not predispose political agendas
Rohan Bhamre: But he seemed like a principaled man to me
Rohan Bhamre: Unworthy of bigotry
Aniket Awasthi: Personally I won't judge anyone this easily
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know Pol Pot?
Rohan Bhamre: I have not read Communist Chinese history so no
Aniket Awasthi: He was all these qualities that you mentioned.
Aniket Awasthi: Khmer Rogue ka naam suna hoga. Pol Pot was the leader of that
Aniket Awasthi: Cambodia me
Aniket Awasthi: He was a well learnt, very soft spoken, disciplined, emotional and soft hearted man. When he was a teacher, people say that he use to cry avidly on small things.
Aniket Awasthi: He turned out to be one of the biggest Genocide perpetrators in modern history
Rohan Bhamre: I have not spoken to pol pot so I can't say Aniket
Aniket Awasthi: Nahi, I am saying that these qualities that you've mentioned are not a yard stick to know if someone is a bigot
Rohan Bhamre: True
Rohan Bhamre: But I asked my dad why would Jayant Sinha garland convicts
Aniket Awasthi: That was for political gain
Rohan Bhamre: Dad thinks Sinha didn't know who was garlanding
Aniket Awasthi: RG is going on Kailash Yatra; it is also for political gain
Rohan Bhamre: Kailash Yatra and garlanding convicts is different
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Aniket Awasthi: True
Aniket Awasthi: But I think it is for political gain
Rohan Bhamre: Cuz these ministers go to local functions on behalf of parties.
Aniket Awasthi: Jharkhand is a very religious place
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Rohan Bhamre: And any tom dick harry comes on stage at local places
Aniket Awasthi: Yes, that can be very well true
Rohan Bhamre: My dad also goes
Rohan Bhamre: He is so busy he just wants to get done with the event and go ahead with schedule
Rohan Bhamre: This shit can happen to my father as well
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: True
Aniket Awasthi: I agree
Aniket Awasthi: Could he have said that he didn't know them later on?
Rohan Bhamre: Even I thought that
Rohan Bhamre: Maybe he thought playing dumb would come across worse
Aniket Awasthi: That would have angered his constituency too
Rohan Bhamre: It's local event
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah
Rohan Bhamre: Dude have you actually read Quran in its entirety
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Not the original one
Aniket Awasthi: Original form is totally random, it can't be comprehended
Rohan Bhamre: It's a convenient feature for the absurd
Aniket Awasthi: http://mquran.org/content/view/527/4/
Aniket Awasthi: Read the successive verses
Aniket Awasthi: You'll know it is not in chronology
Apoorv Umang: How do you beat someone without hitting them in the face? Stomach?
Rohan Bhamre: Wtf?
Apoorv Umang: That mquran verse
Aniket Awasthi: Hey bhagwaan
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Did you see the new few verses @917891947877 ?
Aniket Awasthi: Bilkul incoherent hai;
Apoorv Umang: Yeah
Aniket Awasthi: Many islamists just directly quote random verses to radicalise people
Aniket Awasthi: When people question them out; they say that 'it is out of context'
Aniket Awasthi: It is a major drawback of quran; it is randomly arranged.
Rohan Bhamre: You mean like when the Quran calls for conquest against infidels and some dudes kill infidels in the name of jihad and people bitch about jihad then Islamists say jihad is actually an 'internal struggle' of a person
Rohan Bhamre: I don't actually know if there are such explicit instructions of destruction against infidels in the Quran. Are there any@Aniket

Rohan Bhamre: I was totally anticipating shubhayan/ambi to post about this
Rohan Bhamre: Haha
Arpit Saxena: Surpsingly RSS supports it
Arpit Saxena: To some extent
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah they support decriminalization of homesexuality, but are against same-sex marriages
Arpit Saxena: https://m.timesofindia.com/india/homosexuality-not-a-crime-but-unnatural-rss/articleshow/65703402.cms
Rohan Bhamre: I for one am against criminalization of homosexuality but against normalisation of the same
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Better than the endless tirade against Islamists :ghost:
Rohan Bhamre: It's more fun
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nothing follows the normal distribution
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah yeah...
Rohan Bhamre: Not just that. It's more relevant
Rohan Bhamre: To a much higher degree than you'd imagine
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I stick with 3D
Rohan Bhamre: I dislike naturalist arguments
Rohan Bhamre: The assertion that if something is natural hence good, and the unnatural the bad
Rohan Bhamre: Has no basis in humanity
Shubhayan Ghoshal: True. Everyone has their own idiosyncrasies. Homogeneizing society is not cool. Leads to Cultural Revolutions. I'm happy RSS is pro decriminalization.
Aniket Awasthi: But everyone should know that public obscenity is still a crime. :face_with_tears_of_joy:

Arpit Saxena: Shows streamed 3hrs ago on YouTube
Aniket Awasthi: What is very special about it?
Kartik Vermun: Joe Rogan does some good podcasts
Arpit Saxena: Nothing, just a good guest on JRE after a long time
Arpit Saxena: Yeah
Arpit Saxena: Good interviewer
Aniket Awasthi: Ok
Kartik Vermun: Will watch the entire thing soon
Aniket Awasthi: BTW; Mercedes launched a high end electric car now
Arpit Saxena: Makes it entertaining but also asks hard questions usually
Arpit Saxena: It's 2.5 hours so not a quick interview
Kartik Vermun: Damn

Arpit Saxena: That's avg JRE length

Kartik Vermun: satya album share kiya hai
Aniket Awasthi: Faltu useless. These things are already going online
Rohan Bhamre: Hey what do you think about soaring fuel prices
Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not sure what India can do with the US sanctions on importing oil from Iran. Many countries are suffering I guess
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/10/oil-markets-us-energy-us-sanctions-on-iran-china-us-trade-in-focus.html
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: The sad part is he is not wrong
Aniket Awasthi: India ko jab Pata hai ki they are dependent on oil. Tab bhi why aren't they changing their habits?
Aniket Awasthi: Indians are fools
Aniket Awasthi: Japan has hedged themselves against oil with their investment in public transport and trains
Aniket Awasthi: They developed nuclear power too. But after fukuyama issue they had to rely on gas. Gas is a much more competitive market than oil
Aniket Awasthi: Indians are wannabe amreekans. Amreeka can pull of oil geo politics due to their financial sector and huge military. They have the diplomatic and military capabilities to ensure oil supply. India par Agar blockade lagega to India ke paas tanks move karne ka bhi oil nahi hoga
Aniket Awasthi: We have been crying about oil since 2 decades now. And we have done nothing
Aniket Awasthi: This is a quintessential example of foolishness
Rohan Bhamre: What are we lacking ?
Arpit Saxena: That was a fiery rant
Rohan Bhamre: Political willpower?
Aniket Awasthi: Basic economics
Rohan Bhamre: Hey I had used this phrase before
Kartik Vermun: Aniket super pissed it seems
Aniket Awasthi: Why aren't their trains?
Aniket Awasthi: Why aren't there metros
Aniket Awasthi: Wait I'll share a data plot
Rohan Bhamre: I'm pretty sure Aniket business and political leaders are aware of what to do but are incapable
Rohan Bhamre: *unable
Arpit Saxena: I can't image what Delhi would be like without metro. So much of Delhi's productivity depends on it
Aniket Awasthi: Haan. Delhi is the only successful metro
Aniket Awasthi: I don't think so. Gadkari just announced huge 7 lakh crore plan to build roads.
Aniket Awasthi: Idk why aren't they investing in freight corridors?
Aniket Awasthi: 12 saal se ban raha hai. Abhi tak nahi bana
Arpit Saxena: Is this a hand drawn one
Kartik Vermun: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: USA uses more trains than India
Aniket Awasthi: When we know that oil is the vulnerability. Doing nothing about it is foolish.
Aniket Awasthi: Middle class has no other option but to buy cars. There's no real public transport available
Rohan Bhamre: What is the useful information in this
Rohan Bhamre: Where is this said
Aniket Awasthi: Economic survey
Aniket Awasthi: And USA is a quintessential car country.
Aniket Awasthi: They use cars for passenger transportation
Aniket Awasthi: This is just about freight
Aniket Awasthi: Uber invited Tokyo governor Koike as a keynote speaker at their flying taxis summit. Instead she is talking about rail networks and renovating bridges. Send help :sleeping_face: :sleeping_face: https://t.co/ZJSROW6LUO
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Because heavy trucks are the future. Advancements in the stability of concrete highways and large trucks have outweighed those in railways. Freight in railways continues to slower, more prone to spillage and late deliveries.
Aniket Awasthi: That's true for developed countries but not India
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Roads have become better. The sizes of trucks transferring loads are ginormous. Dad had remarked this to me while dwelling on reduced demand for freight via railways due to preference for trucks.
Aniket Awasthi: That's true for commodities. Is it true for heavy goods too? India me we are transporting cement, sand etc from trucks too
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah, I guess the revenues from commodities are higher than heavy goods.
Ambikesh Mishra: Does India have viable energy alternatives? I remember reading long time back that none of solar, wind, hydro etc are consistent year-round( monsoons, no wind ) to be economically feasible
Aniket Awasthi: India has decreasing plf
Ambikesh Mishra: Plf = plant load factor?
Aniket Awasthi: Haan
Aniket Awasthi: But 2% peak load deficiency
Aniket Awasthi: India can manage power
Ambikesh Mishra: I meant for like solar trains like Australia is doing or options such as making codes for making public busses/transport to be solar/electric
Ambikesh Mishra: To start shifting dependence
Ambikesh Mishra: It's not possible to indigenously develop theae technologies. It's taken decades & millions of dollars of investment to get where they are
Ambikesh Mishra: Which again leads to reliance on imports. I strongly believe that many of India's economic problems are due it having a laughable R & D sector
Aniket Awasthi: Actually India has an issue with the financial sector
Aniket Awasthi: Banks control the credit
Aniket Awasthi: Public sector banks. Rather than investment banks

Aniket Awasthi: Ok. I thought your father will be there too
Aniket Awasthi: Or you would have arranged something there
Rohan Bhamre: Brother says staying with army is unwise
Aniket Awasthi: Why.
Aniket Awasthi: ?
Rohan Bhamre: Isn't the army the main target
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. But civilians are easy target. Recently these people have started targeting civilians and local policemen
Rohan Bhamre: Yes that's what I read too
Rohan Bhamre: Since May 2018
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Apoorv Umang: What's the chance that there will be 2 attacks in a month? You're safer now

Rohan Bhamre: Some glitch in ecto's program today
Arpit Saxena: Wrong chat
Arpit Saxena: But yeah
Rohan Bhamre: Where else do you chat about celebs?
Satya: How long were you sleeping
Satya: :face_with_raised_eyebrow:
Arpit Saxena: Didn't know agr
Satya: :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Arpit Saxena: Age
Kartik Vermun: @917407650530 How much younger would you approve?
Rohan Bhamre: Bro I think if I guy marries girl several years younger
Rohan Bhamre: *elder
Rohan Bhamre: He will miss out on a lot
Rohan Bhamre: Cuz girls age faster anyways
Rohan Bhamre: 10 years is gn
Rohan Bhamre: In which case I think he 'truly loves' her
Rohan Bhamre: ?????
Kartik Vermun: Can't imagine Arpit doing celeb gossip
Rohan Bhamre: He just did
Kartik Vermun: I know
Rohan Bhamre: I don't mind!
Rohan Bhamre: Let's bitch about those elite fucks
Rohan Bhamre: When I see symphony X barely getting 100000 on YouTube on their best songs
Kartik Vermun: That guy, khal drogo in got married someone way older
Rohan Bhamre: And then these so ccalled 'talented artists ' like lil Wayne get billion views on God knows what
Rohan Bhamre: Really grinds my gears
Ambikesh Mishra: I recently started to understand hip hop. Stuff like Eminem, jayz. It's an interesting little world based on word play and bars
Rohan Bhamre: Would you say this is a symptom of cultural Marxism
Ambikesh Mishra: It started out like that I guess primarily African American. But now is the most capitalistic in the music industry. Way more than rock
Rohan Bhamre: Revenue structure is sure
Rohan Bhamre: We are talking a out the music though
Rohan Bhamre: The demand
Rohan Bhamre: The common man's taste
Rohan Bhamre: Blacks played and listened to jazz
Rohan Bhamre: Because they tried to be like whites
Ambikesh Mishra: Depends on the artists. Lil pump Gucci gang for example is just a guy high on cocaine. More like being gangsta is cool. You could say that's anti corporate
Ambikesh Mishra: It's like numetal. It sounds cool and catchy so more popular
Ambikesh Mishra: Artists like Eminem though have pretty serious talent. You could analyze his wordplay for days
Rohan Bhamre: Talent is there
Ambikesh Mishra: Also I don't think music elitism is good. I feel any sort of elitism means that we haven't really figured something out
Rohan Bhamre: Elitism is always bad
Ambikesh Mishra: Most dt fans are like that for example
Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I think I'm missing the point now
Ambikesh Mishra: There has to be some neuro science behind why more people prefer pop music
Ambikesh Mishra: Would be interesting to learn
Rohan Bhamre: There's a nuance you did not acknowledge
Ambikesh Mishra: Which one?
Rohan Bhamre: Would you say all tastes in music are equal
Rohan Bhamre: Too ambiguous
Rohan Bhamre: Sorry I'll phrase it better next time we meet hopefully
Ambikesh Mishra: Not at all. The more you practice listening to music, the more refined the ear
Rohan Bhamre: Exactly so disparity in taste is eventual
Ambikesh Mishra: I would argue casual listeners have poorer tastes
Rohan Bhamre: So yes elites would exist
Rohan Bhamre: The bad thing would be elites to behave arrogantly with others
Rohan Bhamre: But not to acknowledge their superior tastes is denial
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Elitism is natural course of society
Rohan Bhamre: The term I was advocating was meritocracy
Ambikesh Mishra: I think its one of those things pointless to be elite at
Rohan Bhamre: Not elitism
Aniket Awasthi: Arrogance is not welcome
Rohan Bhamre: Yes I would say cultural Marxism has damaged meritocracy in music
Rohan Bhamre: Where merit is musical talent
Rohan Bhamre: And not brand
Ambikesh Mishra: Ultimately the point of music is the value or entertainment derived from it. Does having better taste equate to deriving more pleasure? I would argue no so it's pointless to have better taste
Rohan Bhamre: Can't disagree
Ambikesh Mishra: What pleases the brain is biological
Ambikesh Mishra: Taste is an imagined cultivated thing. Biology trumps that
Aniket Awasthi: I've a different take here. I feel that society should follow what is called "high culture". High culture comes through perfection, dedication and hardwork. Pop music involves no such traits hence is detestable.
Rohan Bhamre: I think it has trickling down effects
Rohan Bhamre: Nvm
Aniket Awasthi: Regarding pleasure, any music will become pleasurable if you hear it again and again
Rohan Bhamre: Well pop music does take hard work and what not
Rohan Bhamre: In a way
Aniket Awasthi: That's how pop culture works
Aniket Awasthi: "Jk" right?
Aniket Awasthi: Hip feels
Rohan Bhamre: Composition distribution advertising :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: *mixing
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I agree. Pop music is definitely trivial.
Rohan Bhamre: Don't you think this undermines creativity
Rohan Bhamre: Sets a bad precedent
Ambikesh Mishra: Im not so sure about that. Dissonant will always sound bad
Rohan Bhamre: Hey, there's good proof. Have ever found yourself lipsing with that korean guy song
Rohan Bhamre: Gangnam style
Rohan Bhamre: That song was a hit because of advertising of epic proportions
Ambikesh Mishra: Not really. I think it's harder to make music good sound than it is to have mechanical skills like playing fast
Rohan Bhamre: Beatles is ez as fuck
Rohan Bhamre: Yet they are creative
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not talking about 'harder to create' music
Ambikesh Mishra: I meant dissonant in a musical interval sense
Ambikesh Mishra: Gangnam style is not dissonant
Ambikesh Mishra: And the human ear specially likes repetitive beats
Rohan Bhamre: Point is absolutely tasteless tracks can be lodged in your brain
Rohan Bhamre: And familiarity will eventually make you like it
Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's the other way round. Your brain always likes that repetitive beat but your taste subconsciously tries to convince it that it sucks
Rohan Bhamre: Hey @917891947877
Rohan Bhamre: Having a blast ?
Arpit Saxena: Wow Maine kya chhed diya

Arpit Saxena: How does he have time for memes
Aniket Awasthi: He's a billionaire. He hires people to work for him. So he will have free time
Arpit Saxena: He's CEO of 3 companies
Arpit Saxena: If he was chairman/investor it would make sense
Aniket Awasthi: There's a conspiracy theory that Elon musk is catering to his fan base. Californian geeks and nerds
Arpit Saxena: Of course he is
Arpit Saxena: But understanding memes takes times u need to keep up
Aniket Awasthi: He's not creating a product but he's creating a cult
Arpit Saxena: Or they become stale

Aniket Awasthi: You can read about psychology of revolution
Arpit Saxena: Sup
Arpit Saxena: Been in bus for almso 3 hours now
Arpit Saxena: Finally getting home
Aniket Awasthi: I was going through it recently. So apparently, it's not about absolute inequality but relative inequality that causes distress in the society.
Rohan Bhamre: Hey I may be wrong but isn't it known
Aniket Awasthi: Further it's not even about possession of wealth but display of wealth that incite revolutions and distress
Aniket Awasthi: Popular belief is that poverty buds distress. But most distressed people are the lower middle class in any society
Rohan Bhamre: Cuz we know that although poor people are getting richer, the rich are getting richer faster, which is a problem for peasants
Rohan Bhamre: Aur bata eb.
Rohan Bhamre: Koi ladki kuch

Rohan Bhamre: You know those days speaking French was an 'in' thing.
Rohan Bhamre: Even in mediaeval times, European nobility used to employ french governess for their children's upbringing
Rohan Bhamre: Because the French were perceived as culturally most sophisticated
Rohan Bhamre: Back when high culture mattered

Ambikesh Mishra: I'll work on it today
Kartik Vermun: Guys met with Arpit and Satya today

Kartik Vermun: Sad Satya doesn't have his passport
Kartik Vermun: We could have gone to Sri Lanka
Ambikesh Mishra: +1for that
Kartik Vermun: Yeah
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Kanha's pretty good too. SL was cool.
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Saw lotsa elephants at a watering hole
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah kanha is not bad tbh
Kartik Vermun: Acha
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Guess it's always more the folks that count
Kartik Vermun: You coming?
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'll see the snaps
Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
Shubhayan Ghoshal: But yeah make sure the Meetup happens
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Naye naye job main lagta Hain chutti mushkil Hain, par mil jati hain

Ambikesh Mishra: Okay cool
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Pilots have been known to crash failing flights outside city areas. Less damage to the economy.
Aniket Awasthi: Saving human lives?
Aniket Awasthi: Of damage to the property?
Rohan Bhamre: Both are true for shubhayans case
Aniket Awasthi: Matlab both are the objective?
Rohan Bhamre: Both can be the objective with same result
Rohan Bhamre: My phrasing is probably shit right now. Just getting back from work sorry
Rohan Bhamre: Fucks up my mind
Aniket Awasthi: Haan. Usually in ethics many good outcomes are not the objective
Aniket Awasthi: Jaise kant ke ethics me. Doing good isn't the objective but it's a byproduct
Aniket Awasthi: Aise
Rohan Bhamre: Got it
Rohan Bhamre: Have you seen rocket singh
Aniket Awasthi: No
Rohan Bhamre: Wish it's model worked IRL
Rohan Bhamre: Work happiness is objective, profit is byproduct
Rohan Bhamre: But then again cant define work happiness
Aniket Awasthi: Japanese work ethics
Aniket Awasthi: They are perfectionists
Rohan Bhamre: Great culture
Rohan Bhamre: Wonder how anime is going to shape that
Shubhayan Ghoshal: I thought the Japanese defined work as a goal unto itself
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: They don't strive for happiness really from work
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's pretty different from European or American societies, where the trend is that your life outside of work is what defines you.
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know that have a word for death due to work?
Aniket Awasthi: Karoshi
Rohan Bhamre: Aniket was born in the wrong culture, guys
Aniket Awasthi: Yeah. Wanted to be an Afghan
Rohan Bhamre: And live where
Aniket Awasthi: Helmand
Rohan Bhamre: Fuck is there
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Opium
Aniket Awasthi: Yuss. Like hekmatyar
Rohan Bhamre: Aah opium magnate pashtunlord
Aniket Awasthi: On a serious note. Japanese culture is really a high culture
Aniket Awasthi: Only country to gain top living standards without migration
Aniket Awasthi: Poora homegrown
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nordic countries?
Aniket Awasthi: Us etc import a lot of talent. Their research is 50% by immigrants
Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're opening up now apparently
Aniket Awasthi: They have natural resources
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. But not allowing for residence rights
Shubhayan Ghoshal: South Korea and Taiwan are same model I guess but not as advanced
Aniket Awasthi: Or citizenship
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Hmm
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's a deeply homogeneous society
Aniket Awasthi: Sk did.
Aniket Awasthi: Japanese have one of the highest savings rate
Aniket Awasthi: Even today
Aniket Awasthi: Patriarchal bhi hain thode thode
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sk is still quite low (3.6% population is foreign)
Rohan Bhamre: What about their population
Aniket Awasthi: That too from China etc
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah. My uncle worked in SK for a while
Aniket Awasthi: They are finally increasing tfr
Aniket Awasthi: But it's far from 2.1
Aniket Awasthi: They have two castes in Japan
Aniket Awasthi: Lower caste called kawai caste has very low tfr
Aniket Awasthi: Their nationalists have 3-4 children
Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-sex-problem-demographic-time-bomb-birth-rates-sex-robots-fertility-crisis-virgins-romance-porn-a7831041.html
Aniket Awasthi: You know. UK also has this issue. Just that their immigrants and momins have 3-4 kids. Hence their average improves
Aniket Awasthi: Whites have similar tfr
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Why Alaska??
Aniket Awasthi: UK has about 10-15% non white population. With high tfr
Aniket Awasthi: Gareeb log hain wahan
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Like the middle of US
Aniket Awasthi: White tfr is similar to that of Japan
Aniket Awasthi: The problem is that Japanese parents find difficult to raise kids there. Very high cost of education etc
Aniket Awasthi: I mean good education
Aniket Awasthi: Just like urban Indian couples
Rohan Bhamre: Talk about France a bit
Rohan Bhamre: Pretty big what's going on there no?
Rohan Bhamre: Especially given it's history.....
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. It's not even lead by any political group
Aniket Awasthi: Ad hoc
Aniket Awasthi: I think it's a larger consequence of neo liberal order
Aniket Awasthi: The lower class isn't getting much fruits of development.
Aniket Awasthi: Wage rates have become nearly saturated
Aniket Awasthi: Then comes the new automation techniques
Aniket Awasthi: I'm seeing a larger picture here maybe.
Aniket Awasthi: Correct me if I'm wrong
Rohan Bhamre: Very specific things triggered the protests though
Aniket Awasthi: Also France has lost its religion
Aniket Awasthi: Cigarettes par tax was also an issue :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The French love their revolutions
Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're very similar to Bongs I've heard
Rohan Bhamre: Chalo bhosdiwalo
Rohan Bhamre: BCG office shut down hota h last week of December
Rohan Bhamre: Book the fucking tickets

Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah
Rohan Bhamre: Given that it originated in europe
Rohan Bhamre: It's weird badminton isn't really popular anywhere except for asia
Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. I don't know why. It's more exhausting and faster paced than tennis

Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Trek can be done in amarkantak too
Aniket Awasthi: It's a hilly place and scerene place. Ambi do you think so?

Kartik Vermun: You guys wanna have a call
Kartik Vermun: @917407650530 there?
Aniket Awasthi: 3 safari are needed. Many a times we can't see any tiger
Aniket Awasthi: It's a matter of luck
Ambikesh Mishra: It's only two mornings and an evening
Ambikesh Mishra: We could do the break the same day as the safari
Ambikesh Mishra: Trek
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Trek
Ambikesh Mishra: It ends at like 8 9 am
Aniket Awasthi: On jungle trail
Rohan Bhamre: Ok

Rohan Bhamre: I concede
Aniket Awasthi: It's banned
Aniket Awasthi: Now
Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah someone died
Kartik Vermun: Okay ankit jain told me he did years ago
Ambikesh Mishra: I did that once in 2006
Aniket Awasthi: Supreme Court banned it
Kartik Vermun: To tiger bhi in a jeep safari
Aniket Awasthi: Elephants are now exclusively for forest department and not for tourism
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Kartik Vermun: Kya risk nahi hota
Aniket Awasthi: No
Aniket Awasthi: Tigers don't attack humans
Aniket Awasthi: Especially in a car
Rohan Bhamre: But they do on elephants?

Kartik Vermun: Okay
Aniket Awasthi: Afternoon
Kartik Vermun: When are you guys returning?
Aniket Awasthi: 30th morning or afternoon ka rakh lo
Aniket Awasthi: I'll suggest
Aniket Awasthi: Did anyone follow the Google congressional hearing?
Aniket Awasthi: Do you think Google is biased?
Kartik Vermun: Sundar pichai
Kartik Vermun: He made a pretty good defense from the bits which I saw
Aniket Awasthi: I don't think so.
Aniket Awasthi: I didn't find his answers satisfactory. It wasn't detailed on many parts
Aniket Awasthi: For example. He had no defense on Google showing personalized search
Aniket Awasthi: It's true that their algorithm can't be manipulated by any human. But he didn't answer if the algorithms are unbiased by design
Aniket Awasthi: There was a part on external audit but again Google hired those companies
Kartik Vermun: Companies hiring other companies for audit is pretty common
Aniket Awasthi: Yes
Aniket Awasthi: Did you try duckduckgo?
Kartik Vermun: Yes
Kartik Vermun: I've tried it as well
Aniket Awasthi: Views?
Kartik Vermun: Prefer Google search over it
Aniket Awasthi: Apparently ddg also uses Google and yahoo
Aniket Awasthi: I prefer ddg in case of any controversial case. Or regarding news
Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
Rohan Bhamre: As far as anti conservative bias, why aren't they calling YouTube patreon etc who are actually suppressing conservative voices
Rohan Bhamre: And please I am not talking about idiots like alex johns
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Isn't YouTube owned by Google?
Rohan Bhamre: Alphabet is the parent company of Google and YouTube
Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's a Google subsidiary.
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. This is right
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Aniket Awasthi: @917407650530 @917891947877 Need your inputs. You know more about this
Rohan Bhamre: I don't they did what you think they did in Google.
Rohan Bhamre: *I don't think they did
Apoorv Umang: at its core, if something is reference in a popular site it carries more weightage that its mention on unpopular sites
Apoorv Umang: so sometimes if people highly upvote and image on reddit with certain keywords it shows in google image search
Apoorv Umang: than its mention*
Apoorv Umang: an image*
Kartik Vermun: You are explaining page rank
Apoorv Umang: yes
Rohan Bhamre: In that case was YouTube discussed
Apoorv Umang: perhaps googles indexing is faster and it gives importance to recent stuff
Arpit Saxena: It's still very irrelevant results
Rohan Bhamre: Perception vs accuracy
Apoorv Umang: @917407650530 why hasnt google fixed it tho, maybe it doesn't consider it wrong?
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Irrelevant results should be fixed
Arpit Saxena: Knowledge cards are curated, this kid be of search term should be considered in that category only I think
Arpit Saxena: Kind of#
Apoorv Umang: explain please. which search term should be considered in what category
Arpit Saxena: Search for fool in Google search
Arpit Saxena: It shows knowledge card
Arpit Saxena: But not for idiot
Arpit Saxena: They already have an algorithm to find such terms
Apoorv Umang: idiot shows too
Arpit Saxena: Oh yeah
Arpit Saxena: Hmm
Aniket Awasthi: Haan
Aniket Awasthi: I just searched
Arpit Saxena: I think idiot is highlighted just because of recent news
Arpit Saxena: Thode din mein wapas theek ho jauega
Aniket Awasthi: Google has too much weight on current main stream media I think
Apoorv Umang: another reason is because pple try to exploit google's algorithm, like 4chan
Apoorv Umang: they can explout others too but they dont have incentive
Apoorv Umang: like ddg
Aniket Awasthi: Point
Aniket Awasthi: But shouldn't Google be beware of it and make results robust
Rohan Bhamre: Arey some months ago Google had absolutely ridiculous results for some searches
Rohan Bhamre: Like American family, white mom, American scientists
Rohan Bhamre: Etc
Rohan Bhamre: I don't exactly remember
Arpit Saxena: American scientists k tha
Rohan Bhamre: @917407650530 ?
Arpit Saxena: Likely its was biased because of similar term African American scietlntist
Kartik Vermun: You were searching white moms?
Rohan Bhamre: Lul
Arpit Saxena: Which is a more common search term
Rohan Bhamre: No I read an article which claimed this. And then I went ahead and searched and it was actually ridiculous
Rohan Bhamre: American scientists were all black :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Rohan Bhamre: Like 95%
Rohan Bhamre: Other searches I don't remember
Rohan Bhamre: Probably white mother showing only interracial couples
Arpit Saxena: The first scientist is still black
Arpit Saxena: Xd
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: Lol
Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
Arpit Saxena: Google is better
Aniket Awasthi: Bc. Sab hi black
Rohan Bhamre: Don't we all ( )
Kartik Vermun: You have a girl
Aniket Awasthi: If one has a cake. Doesn't mean that he won't like a gulab jamun
Kartik Vermun: And how does the cake feel about gulab jamun?
Arpit Saxena: Nice moral policing Kartik
Kartik Vermun: Lol
Kartik Vermun: Curiosity
Arpit Saxena: Xd
Aniket Awasthi: @919422709999 how does the cake feel?
Kartik Vermun: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Cake doesn't need to know
Rohan Bhamre: Calm your tits guys
Rohan Bhamre: It's just thoughts
Rohan Bhamre: I'm not actually advocating unfaithfulness
Aniket Awasthi: Strategic disclaimer. Noice
Ambikesh Mishra: Mother of my kids...
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Arey sale:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: Best comment of the day. Starred *
Rohan Bhamre: Kya ambikesh.
Rohan Bhamre: Can't even have a private conversation :pensive_face:
Ambikesh Mishra: Yup aseem da with tejan matta is the way to do it
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Aniket Awasthi: Savage. Rohan has lost his talent of mocking ambi
Rohan Bhamre: I dont mock anyone now dude
Rohan Bhamre: Log bhadakne lag gayee h
Aniket Awasthi: Mocking ambi is like your super powrr
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: No I'm not falling for your pit fight trap
Ambikesh Mishra: I was watching a PewDiePie videp yesterday and that's what he said about india
Ambikesh Mishra: He had made fun of ekta Kapoor
Rohan Bhamre: Yeah he parodied indian TV serial
Rohan Bhamre: The producer got serious
Kartik Vermun: He must be receiving death threats
Aniket Awasthi: :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Whereas her serials are silly even to many Indians
Ambikesh Mishra: Getting offended is such a weird culture dependent thing. Americans get extremely offended if someone honks at them
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Rohan Bhamre: Looking to buy a car for me
Rohan Bhamre: Any suggestions?
Rohan Bhamre: Budget 13
Aniket Awasthi: No idea
Rohan Bhamre: Medium sedans
Apoorv Umang: buy indian with tax money
Rohan Bhamre: I guess wrong group:unamused_face:
Aniket Awasthi: Do you know the tax rate in California?
Aniket Awasthi: Effective tax is about 50-55% of the income. For high earning salaried individuals
Rohan Bhamre: Baapre
Aniket Awasthi: 42% is the highest income slab
Aniket Awasthi: Then indirect taxes are more.
Aniket Awasthi: They don't even provide free health care
Aniket Awasthi: I don't know where do they use all this tax money?!
Aniket Awasthi: Building roads?
Rohan Bhamre: Military comes to mind
Aniket Awasthi: California ki military kahan hai

Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/5W0Ql7EDfu4
Rohan Bhamre: Wow Sadhguru and Frawley together
Arpit Saxena: 1 hr video 30mins of ads
Arpit Saxena: https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall
Aniket Awasthi: Still better than tipping mediocre female dota gamer on twitch
Aniket Awasthi: But 11 million is noice
Arpit Saxena: 11mil in 4 days wtf
Rohan Bhamre: Wow so many racists!
Aniket Awasthi: People earn $1000 around in an hour long stream
Kartik Vermun: People actually funding this :flushed_face:
Rohan Bhamre: And nazis
Aniket Awasthi: @14043680303 @18144419636 Aap bhi Daan de do
Shubhayan Ghoshal: The Chinese were pretty damn racist too
Rohan Bhamre: Guess we just found a metric to reliably measure racism
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Guess so
Aniket Awasthi: Btw. Anyone believes in eugenics around here?
Rohan Bhamre: What's there to believe
Arpit Saxena: Didn't know if watch twitch
Rohan Bhamre: Like it's good or bad waisa kya
Arpit Saxena: You*
Aniket Awasthi: That some traits are better than other traits
Rohan Bhamre: You don't need to watch twitch to get information
Rohan Bhamre: Isnt it obvious
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Natural mutations allow for critical advancement of species
Rohan Bhamre: Natural mutations for advancement is really to just increase survivability fitness value
Aniket Awasthi: Actually eugenics is a wrong concept. A trait can be good or bad depending on the environment. Like taller humans are considered better today but midgets will be better if we have to live in a cave
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Aye
Rohan Bhamre: We're not going back to the cave anytime soon
Aniket Awasthi: Not you. But your specie might have to
Aniket Awasthi: You never know
Rohan Bhamre: Anytime soon
Aniket Awasthi: For a specie a few thousand years is a very small amount of time
Aniket Awasthi: You can't predict the next 50 years let alone next 500 years
Rohan Bhamre: Ofcourse, fitness value really depends on the environment
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Much of human development for 'survival of fittest' is sociological and technological
Apoorv Umang: Jamaicans can run fast because of genes
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Our innovations have outpaced natural selection
Shubhayan Ghoshal: True. However most human survival no longer relies on running fast
Apoorv Umang: Is eugenics about mental differences between races or physical too?
Apoorv Umang: Yeah technological advances are too fast for natural selection to have an effect
Rohan Bhamre: Advances in medicine
Rohan Bhamre: Faulty genes are more successful in carrying over
Rohan Bhamre: Than otherwise
Rohan Bhamre: ?
Apoorv Umang: But artificial selection fat
Apoorv Umang: Fast
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Iq is also genetic
Shubhayan Ghoshal: Going to go all scientific and cite Wikipedia: "a major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of genetic diversity, resulting in inbreeding depression due to lower genetic variation."
Aniket Awasthi: This happened in dogs. Especially "pure breed" dogs
Rohan Bhamre: Who the fuck likes pugs
Rohan Bhamre: Fucking disgusting rats
Rohan Bhamre: Abominations
Aniket Awasthi: Like great Danes die of heart attack. Bulldogs can't breathe properly
Rohan Bhamre: German shepherd master race
Aniket Awasthi: Only viable dogs in caves
Aniket Awasthi: :grinning_squinting_face:
Rohan Bhamre: Bhai tu reh cave me
Aniket Awasthi: All we need is a jihadi Pakistani to start a nuclear war. Nuclear winter
Apoorv Umang: Like we have completely changed plants and animals in around 1000 years through artificial selection
Apoorv Umang: So breeding smart people we might create smarter people? Isn't that possible?
Rohan Bhamre: Do we have the tech to do that in a robust manner
Rohan Bhamre: To avoid this
Aniket Awasthi: Yes. It is possible. But it creates other issues due to many recessive genes expressing themselves. Like they might be very smart but mighty suffer from a very weak cardio vascular system
Aniket Awasthi: Not at the moment. Solving this genetic problem is a np-hard problem as of now
Rohan Bhamre: Lagao GA:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Aniket Awasthi: People are working in that direction though
Aniket Awasthi: Like this Chinese guy recently designed a genetically engineered baby. He cut out the HIV gene using crispr
Aniket Awasthi: But this isn't a robust method as we don't have any information about the other side effects of such gene editing.
Aniket Awasthi: Hence a np hard problem
Rohan Bhamre: Aporv aa Raha hai kya tu
Apoorv Umang: No
Apoorv Umang: Other plans
Arpit Saxena: Jews
Arpit Saxena: /s
Rohan Bhamre: Aur kuch batao
Apoorv Umang: Why /s isn't that a fact? Jews have higher iq?
Rohan Bhamre: Anything controversial
Apoorv Umang: Sorry my metro ride just ended ttyl
Rohan Bhamre: My outstation ride gonna last a while
Rohan Bhamre: Taxation is theft change my mind
Arpit Saxena: Say that to your dad
Rohan Bhamre: Why the personal attacks
Arpit Saxena: He will change your mind
Rohan Bhamre: Baat chedne k liye I said that phrase
Rohan Bhamre: I don't actually believe that
Rohan Bhamre: I noticed a lot of people think that
Arpit Saxena: How tf you build roads
Rohan Bhamre: So wanted some discussion
Arpit Saxena: Apparently India has low tax rate even among 3rd world countries
Arpit Saxena: 17% GDP or something
Rohan Bhamre: And even less tax efficiency
Aniket Awasthi: No. Tax rate is high. Tax to Gdp is low
Arpit Saxena: China is 22
Arpit Saxena: Yeah
Arpit Saxena: Collection I mean
Aniket Awasthi: This is right
Aniket Awasthi: People don't pay taxes in india that easily
Aniket Awasthi: Roads are anyways build on toll model
Arpit Saxena: Nor must of them
Arpit Saxena: Most
Arpit Saxena: Ok givmt hospitals schools colleges
Arpit Saxena: Police force
Arpit Saxena: Army
Arpit Saxena: Farmer loans
Arpit Saxena: /s

Rohan Bhamre: Any tldr of why this happened?
Aniket Awasthi: Various reasons; in short India being India
Rohan Bhamre: Wasn't India being India before
Aniket Awasthi: That time till 2008 was an Era of global boom
Aniket Awasthi: India India also accounts for the largest number of wasted children in the world with low weight for height. India recorded 25.5 million children who are wasted. According to NFHS-4, percentage of wasted children under five years increased from 19.8 per cent in 2005-06 to 21 per cent in 2015-16. Severely wasted children also rose from 6.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent during the same period. Underweight/Overweight Children whose weight is below the average for their age are considered under-weight. Under-weight is an indicator of acute or chronic malnutrition or both. Finding Globally 5.6% or 38.3 million children are overweight. India As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16), 35.7 per cent children below five years are underweight. India is among the few countries to have more than a million overweight children along with China, Indonesia, Egypt, US, Brazil and Pakistan. @18144419636
Satya left
