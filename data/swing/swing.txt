4/7/17, 8:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is the only true way
4/7/17, 8:23 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: To be?
4/7/17, 8:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: To get girls
4/7/17, 8:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Money and looks
4/7/17, 8:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Only 20 percent of girls care about intelligence.
4/7/17, 8:26 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Aren't those the girls we should care about?
4/7/17, 8:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you really want to find intelligence in 'these'
4/7/17, 8:28 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Yes. Though it won't be there.
4/7/17, 8:28 PM - Satya: üòÇüòÇ
4/7/17, 8:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even arpit won't try to find intelligence among these
4/7/17, 8:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Correct me arpit if I'm wrong
4/7/17, 8:31 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I wouldn't try to find. But if it was there, it would be a plus.

4/12/17, 6:50 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Well, he would have probably plotted to blow our brains out in college if it weren't for gun control...
4/12/17, 6:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Who knows! He probably has desi katta with him already

5/22/17, 5:48 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I want to chill, eat pizza and have beer
5/22/17, 5:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No trekking
5/22/17, 5:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: We can take bikes or a car
5/22/17, 5:51 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Car

5/22/17, 5:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Easy *
5/22/17, 5:52 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'm riding behind someone powered by experience
5/22/17, 5:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: We'll rent bikes there but our major tour will be by car
5/22/17, 5:53 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Where are we going again?
5/22/17, 5:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Leh. Any other suggestions?

5/22/17, 5:53 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah bad idea
5/22/17, 5:54 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Leh be expensive

5/22/17, 5:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Road trip from Mumbai to Goa
5/22/17, 5:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Plus it'll be hot
5/22/17, 5:57 PM - Kartik Vermun: We can wait and go when Goa season starts
5/22/17, 5:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's in December. Shubhayan won't be here
5/22/17, 5:57 PM - Kartik Vermun: Shubhayan when do you leave
5/22/17, 5:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Season starts around September I guess
5/22/17, 5:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: August
5/22/17, 5:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He leaves in August
5/22/17, 6:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Leh is a better plan
5/22/17, 7:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to trek
5/22/17, 7:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You fat fucks
5/22/17, 7:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not enough time
5/22/17, 7:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Treks are long
5/22/17, 8:12 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Le me trekking

6/2/17, 12:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Has anyone else got this Shubham kedia guy personal messaging for money?
6/2/17, 12:36 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I got it
6/2/17, 12:36 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I blocked him
6/2/17, 12:38 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think I'll do the same
6/2/17, 12:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: He has money to go to Columbia but not enough to buy a ticket to Brazil. Like wtf
6/2/17, 12:40 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Scam
6/2/17, 12:40 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Shubham got scammed üòõ
6/2/17, 12:41 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Shubhayan
6/2/17, 12:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
6/2/17, 12:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòõ
6/2/17, 12:46 AM - Kartik Vermun: Care to explain Shubhayan?
6/2/17, 12:47 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Nah
6/2/17, 12:47 AM - Kartik Vermun: We all know you gave him money be
6/2/17, 12:48 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Yep
6/2/17, 12:48 AM - Kartik Vermun: Atleast he messaged so in the mentorship group and expected rest to follow your foot step
6/2/17, 12:49 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: It's‚Äã an individual choice. I let him know though that the group is not for sponsorship
6/2/17, 12:50 AM - Kartik Vermun: Abe you were suppose to kick him out
6/2/17, 12:50 AM - Kartik Vermun: That's how you let him know it's not for sponsorship
6/2/17, 12:50 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üëç
6/2/17, 12:52 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea what this is
6/2/17, 12:52 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: And risk 4 mentees without a mentor? I know the guy means well.
6/2/17, 12:53 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: He's not gonna post it again
6/2/17, 12:53 AM - Kartik Vermun: Bcoz of that grp he got all what's app contacts and started spamming us personally
6/2/17, 12:53 AM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah well done Shubhayan
6/2/17, 12:53 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok it seems I live in a cave
6/2/17, 12:54 AM - Kartik Vermun: Slow claps üôè
6/2/17, 12:54 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Dude that's how scamming happens. My Uber recently got hacked by russians
6/2/17, 12:54 AM - Kartik Vermun: üòÇ
6/2/17, 12:54 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Fucking russians
6/2/17, 12:55 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Someone took a limo ride in Moscow using my account
6/2/17, 12:55 AM - Kartik Vermun: ü§î
6/2/17, 12:55 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking Trump donated him my contact probably
6/2/17, 12:55 AM - Kartik Vermun: Fuck man
6/2/17, 12:55 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Fucking drump
6/2/17, 12:56 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'll tell him to not spam you on WhatsApp. I'm not chucking him Outta the group
6/2/17, 12:57 AM - Kartik Vermun: You can get another mentor I'm pretty sure
6/2/17, 12:59 AM - Kartik Vermun: He even send me a mail on Gmail, did you share the emails with him as well?
6/2/17, 1:00 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: It's not that easy Kartik. I've put in my word to a lotta people in Chemical with few replies. If you can help, it would be great
6/2/17, 1:00 AM - Kartik Vermun: Chal chill
6/2/17, 1:00 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Yes, the list is shared on the group after some mentors requested it
6/2/17, 1:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm willing to help him but his plea doesn't make sense. He says he is going to Columbia for masters. That ticket is gonna cost money too. How's he getting that? Loan only pays for tuition and I'm highly doubtful any loan from India can pay for ivy league tuition fee. It all sounds a bit sketchy
6/2/17, 1:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not makes for a good.mentor imo
6/2/17, 1:01 AM - Kartik Vermun: I can see through the bullshit bro
6/2/17, 1:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And personally spamming alums is highly weird
6/2/17, 1:02 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: If you guys don't wish to contribute that's perfectly fine. I'm not gonna say anything. I had a personal reason hence I helped.
6/2/17, 1:04 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'm not sure how much he's spamming. WhatsApp is a no-no. I've let him know that. One email may make sense, but multiple is not good.
6/2/17, 1:05 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Night folks
6/2/17, 1:05 AM - Kartik Vermun: Dm me twice on whatsapp
6/2/17, 1:05 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Such a noob....
6/2/17, 1:06 AM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah makes motives obvious
6/2/17, 1:07 AM - Kartik Vermun: Good plan though, will say that, who knows might have even worked
6/2/17, 1:56 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Or maybe he is astronomically desperate
6/2/17, 4:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Omfg guys I felt an earthquake
6/2/17, 4:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: How big was it?
6/2/17, 4:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: If you see it in news later, know that you heard it here firsf
6/2/17, 4:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Omfg it was fucking scary
6/2/17, 4:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Epicenter must be far away though
6/2/17, 4:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I mean obviously
6/2/17, 4:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But yeag
6/2/17, 4:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Felt it fukcing intense
6/2/17, 4:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Google tells one in j and k
6/2/17, 4:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: 4.5
6/2/17, 4:31 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It happened like a few minutes earlier
6/2/17, 4:44 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah showing up now

6/2/17, 4:44 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Very near delhi
6/2/17, 4:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Extremely near epicenter
6/2/17, 8:33 AM - Kartik Vermun: @919425052635 how was the result?

6/6/17, 6:37 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Here's a weird thought. Have you guys ever wondered how similar Islamic terrorism is to DotA 2 feeding?

The more people flame, the higher chances of players getting tilted and feeding. The more the west bombs in Asia, the more retaliation attacks it gets. If Volvo solved DotA 2 feeding it could lead to world peace
6/6/17, 11:10 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Now I can die in peace
6/6/17, 11:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Ambikesh you should put this on reddit
6/6/17, 11:16 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Would make a decent  sociology thesis topic: human behaviour parallels in Jihadi self destructive ideology and "Peruvian stole mid, I'll go feed."
6/6/17, 11:16 AM - Aniket Awasthi: No. There are only two players in dota
6/6/17, 11:16 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Two teams
6/6/17, 11:16 AM - Aniket Awasthi: *
6/6/17, 11:18 AM - Aniket Awasthi: And the purpose is to let the team win. Hence support can be sacrificed. Geopolitics is al members for themselves, self interest triumphs.
6/6/17, 11:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That makes sense. I don't see any promotion of self interest for people feeding.Though the irrational behavioural and highly toxic state of mind are similar. Plus everyone wants to play mid or core. DotA 2 exemplifies people's true darker side in the online world. Exaggerate it 10x in real life you get your terrorist. The emotions behind it seem uncannily similar.
6/6/17, 11:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Terrorists are feeding
6/6/17, 11:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
6/6/17, 11:24 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Waiting for rohan and arpit to comment
6/6/17, 11:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: US is the 5k player who took mid when a 2k ISIS who marked it first. Having no real power or skills it just decides to feed to make itself feel better
6/6/17, 11:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
6/6/17, 11:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw my Russian Uber hackera

6/23/17, 3:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even i believe that religion is important for society
6/23/17, 4:04 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Religion has some epic stories that inspired Asgardian gods
6/23/17, 4:05 PM - Kartik Vermun: Reminds me of AOM
6/23/17, 4:05 PM - Kartik Vermun: we should play sometime
6/23/17, 4:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How is it important
6/23/17, 4:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Humans can
6/23/17, 4:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And have formed communities without religion
6/23/17, 4:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And as robust
6/23/17, 4:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion gives no exclusive or an added protection to society
6/23/17, 4:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or else intra religion altercations nahi hote
6/23/17, 4:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And please
6/23/17, 4:15 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Not large ones.
6/23/17, 4:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because religion is the largest part of our society today
6/23/17, 4:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And not because it gives strength to society
6/23/17, 4:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But because it was better propogated
6/23/17, 4:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Abe
6/23/17, 4:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's too long to writr
6/23/17, 4:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We shud meet and discuss this
6/23/17, 4:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Way easier
6/23/17, 4:17 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: You can expect enthusiastic response for atheism or agnosticism on a large scale. There's nothing to get excited about
6/23/17, 4:18 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: The same way classical music suffers to Justin Bieber
6/23/17, 4:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because people at large are fools
6/23/17, 4:18 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Exactly
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not good for society
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A human society
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which strives for progress
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion is regression
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Weren't you pro BJP?
6/23/17, 4:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Please......

6/23/17, 4:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: üò¨
6/23/17, 4:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wait
6/23/17, 4:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hadn't I invited Satya
6/23/17, 4:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not that I mind anyone else joining
6/23/17, 4:21 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Well religion helps society as much as Justin Bieber and Katy Perry
6/23/17, 4:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which is to keep large sections of population for actually developing a more sophisticated taste for music
6/23/17, 4:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *from
6/23/17, 4:22 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: The opium of the masses
6/23/17, 4:23 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Religion in itself is not an issue
6/23/17, 4:23 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: People will believe in all sorts of things
6/23/17, 4:23 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: What is really the problem is when it becomes the one defining thing in relating to another man
6/23/17, 4:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's inevitable
6/23/17, 4:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There always will be classification in human society
6/23/17, 4:24 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Classification is fine as long as there is multi-classification
6/23/17, 4:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And yes I am bjp aligned
6/23/17, 4:25 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: So that people can possibly relate on multiple levels
6/23/17, 4:25 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: You are right-aligned :D
6/23/17, 4:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I really don't care for right left
6/23/17, 4:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's too confusing
6/23/17, 4:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There's left in right and right in left
6/23/17, 4:26 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Theirs testosterone in women and oxytocin in men
6/23/17, 4:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: These terms are excruciatingly vague
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: When you split them into socio vs economic it becomes clearer
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I like Ayn Rand
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or rather
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Just discuss specific ideas you believe in
6/23/17, 4:27 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Hard right economically. Hard left socially.
6/23/17, 4:28 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: True
6/23/17, 4:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well

6/23/17, 4:29 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'm calling her a goddess. I'm sure she won't mind.
6/23/17, 4:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Your viewing pleasure would be increased tenfold if you mute her Miss c
6/23/17, 4:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *music
6/23/17, 4:29 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Even God doesn't have a million Twitter followers
6/23/17, 4:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok
6/23/17, 4:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion has its use
6/23/17, 4:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like keep the fools controlled with it
6/23/17, 4:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If you don't have the texh to uplift them
6/23/17, 4:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But when religion actually gains power in a state
6/23/17, 4:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That is foolish
6/23/17, 4:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like theocracy
6/23/17, 4:31 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Say that to Cersei Lannister
6/23/17, 4:31 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: She'll agree
6/23/17, 4:31 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: How is Yogi Adityanath doing?
6/23/17, 4:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea
6/23/17, 4:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why would you ask me that
6/23/17, 4:32 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Katy Perry has 100 million Twitter followers sorry!
6/23/17, 4:32 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I meant as a CM
6/23/17, 4:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket is typing something lengthy
6/23/17, 4:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Humans are clanish. They usually get along in a group of few hundreds in case of absence of any binding information. 

Religion provides that information to humans to expand the society. Hence this allows them to expand beyond a clan. 

Like if someone is a Muslim and you too are Muslim then you can presume a few things about each other. Hence this is a case of presumed information which is likely to be true. Hence you can enter into a deal with some trust. 

While in absence of any binding information we would be rendered into assuming other person as a pure rational with absence of information. 

In short religion helps us to beat the Nash equilibrium of the prisoners dilemma
6/23/17, 4:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Baaaam
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhak
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Where both club each other because if one trusts the other the other may club him
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even language gives tgat
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kuch bhi
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even a common profession gives that
6/23/17, 4:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What assurance does language provide?
6/23/17, 4:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me what assurance does the language provide?
6/23/17, 4:35 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: The ability to communicate our intentions
6/23/17, 4:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Assurance or information
6/23/17, 4:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wait
6/23/17, 4:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Don't you live in india
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How marathis behave with marathi
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Vs non Marathi
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ya Al-uuuh
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Similar with other cultures
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I didn't say that.
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read what I've written
6/23/17, 4:36 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: So it provides a way to bond beyond language
6/23/17, 4:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The debate is too extensive
6/23/17, 4:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A Muslim from Indonesia will bond with a Saudi more readily than a philipino
6/23/17, 4:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We need to talk face to face
6/23/17, 4:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
6/23/17, 4:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's just classification
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You talk random stuff like language. Confine it to religion
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Goddess perry too
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My point is that it's not an exclusive feature of religion
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: He's saying that the work of religion can be accomplished by a number of other tools like language
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You haven't understood what I meant
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: So we can discard it
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any categorization in human society can do that
6/23/17, 4:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
6/23/17, 4:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Listen
6/23/17, 4:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just assume two people of the same language.
6/23/17, 4:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: English.
6/23/17, 4:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Living in America and other in india
6/23/17, 4:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If both are Muslims then they can assume a few feature about each other. Like one would not eat pork
6/23/17, 4:40 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: That saves the world
6/23/17, 4:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This information is very important to think beyond the clan
6/23/17, 4:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's about safe assumptions
6/23/17, 4:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And what if religion didn't exist
6/23/17, 4:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Else humans are very apprehensive about each other especially who are beyond the clan
6/23/17, 4:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What is the loss
6/23/17, 4:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Clanish behavior
6/23/17, 4:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You won't get a few information about a stranger
6/23/17, 4:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: "religion provides another layer of classification"
6/23/17, 4:42 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: But with Facebook and Google Translate Abhi religion ki kya zarurat?
6/23/17, 4:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Basically this right
6/23/17, 4:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Added layer
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How is that
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: We aren't talking about language
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A unique feature
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Speaking a same language doesn't provide any information about the person
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any means of categorization does that
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: IT DOES
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It just eases the means of communication
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It doesn't
6/23/17, 4:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Omfg dudr
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Culture is most tied to language
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What can I assume about a marathi
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Or what can two marathi assume about each other
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So much
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: That he has terrible taste in food
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My god
6/23/17, 4:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇüòÇ

6/23/17, 4:45 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: What can two Indoris assume? Good taste in food!
6/23/17, 4:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Marathis mostly do clerical jobs
6/23/17, 4:45 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: What can an Indori and a Bengali assume. Good taste in food.
6/23/17, 4:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They celebrate certain fests
6/23/17, 4:45 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Really?
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Everybody does

6/23/17, 4:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You find so few biz men
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Haha
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Most biz are guj or Marv here
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I am not talking about the difference. 

I was talking about the information that it conveys
6/23/17, 4:46 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: True among bongs too
6/23/17, 4:47 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: But yeah the info matters
6/23/17, 4:47 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Even no pork eating is meh
6/23/17, 4:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Holy shit
6/23/17, 4:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Firstly. The clerical job etc are related to castes and not language
6/23/17, 4:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Marathi speaking sindis will indulge in business
6/23/17, 4:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sindhi are people who migrated from sindh.
6/23/17, 4:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: After partition
6/23/17, 4:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They mostly indulge in business.
6/23/17, 4:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even though they speak marathi because they live there
6/23/17, 4:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>

6/23/17, 4:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I speak English

6/23/17, 4:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's malwi culture
6/23/17, 4:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow you should now concede that language is not a very important means of conveyed information. 

Yes culture is
6/23/17, 4:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok America is a vast land which speaks English
6/23/17, 4:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There are cultural differences
6/23/17, 4:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: South America speak mostly Spanish
6/23/17, 4:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So?
6/23/17, 4:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yet so many cultural divisions
6/23/17, 4:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Culture and language aren't the same.
6/23/17, 4:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. You mean culture and not language
6/23/17, 4:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You must be grilled for this gaff
6/23/17, 4:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Secondly. 
Culture does provide enough information. 

Religion is an added layer
6/23/17, 4:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Cultures of the two regions can't be the same
6/23/17, 4:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>

6/23/17, 4:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
6/23/17, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's the case of true knowledge of culture
6/23/17, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you know about Vietnamese culture
6/23/17, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
6/23/17, 4:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No
6/23/17, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But you do know about Christianity

6/23/17, 5:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>

6/23/17, 5:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you forgo the religion.
6/23/17, 5:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You essentially have only one presumed information
6/23/17, 5:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That is the culture
6/23/17, 5:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And people don't know cultures easily because there are too many cultures
6/23/17, 5:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I never said that culture is not important
6/23/17, 5:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok
6/23/17, 5:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I said that religion is something that can expand throughout cultures
6/23/17, 5:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence an added information about each other
6/23/17, 5:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Really not relevant in today's times
6/23/17, 5:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why?

6/23/17, 5:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why are you sticking to this point about religion
6/23/17, 5:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Where it behaves exactly like any other method of classification in human society
6/23/17, 5:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And pretending that added layer of info is good enough pro
6/23/17, 5:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: To talk about
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That it's worth keeping human society centuries behind in terms of progress
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me another way to replace that information that you get from religion
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Don't replace
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Afreeka had no religion before Islam
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Probably it was your true society
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They had
6/23/17, 5:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I mean a unifying religion

6/23/17, 5:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's it
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They were extremely conservative people
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Stigma
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Blind Faith rampant
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You're proving my point
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Humans are superstitious
6/23/17, 5:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You can very well argue religion held them back
6/23/17, 5:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Muslims were more progressive
6/23/17, 5:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There are many superstitions beyond religion too
6/23/17, 5:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes

7/7/17, 12:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's theological and philosophical
7/7/17, 12:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That human race will be extinct?
7/7/17, 12:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: "everything has a d day"
7/7/17, 12:08 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I bet one T trx said it to another too: he bro extinction is just theory
7/7/17, 12:08 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: T Rex
7/7/17, 12:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We aren't discussing extinction
7/7/17, 12:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We are discussing extinction due to human conflict in near future
7/7/17, 12:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There is a case which this can occur
7/7/17, 12:09 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah that is just theory. Maybe that conflict just results in population reduction
7/7/17, 12:09 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Extinction will probably take millennials to fully occu
7/7/17, 12:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But for that to occur specific events need to happen in a designate manner
7/7/17, 12:10 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I only.conjecture that it will be a major contributing factor
7/7/17, 12:10 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Which isn't far fetched at all
7/7/17, 12:10 PM - Satya: Water
7/7/17, 12:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Conflicts will happen
7/7/17, 12:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm just saying these conflicts leading to extinction is an eccentric statement
7/7/17, 12:12 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No it's just a contributing factor. But a major one nonetheless
7/7/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: A united race stands a chance against nature but one with internal discord.doesent
7/7/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's not eccentric at all in my view
7/7/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: We should right now be focusing on havens outside of earth
7/7/17, 12:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Given the tech that we have
7/7/17, 12:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aren't we
7/7/17, 12:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Tech aage to jaane de
7/7/17, 12:14 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No we arent. Space research is so under funded these days
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Abe
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dude
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Tech goes ahead when people invest in it
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Of course one world government sounds good
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Won't work
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: More reasonable
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Talk in real terms
7/7/17, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Civil wars internal conflict hote rahenge
7/7/17, 12:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Current world order is probably the best we have possibly have
7/7/17, 12:16 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Funding is a bitch, can't rely on it. Private sector main hoga now üòé
7/7/17, 12:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No doubt we should still strive for a better global society
7/7/17, 12:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Democracy was an outlandish notion 2000 years ago present in 1 or 2 countries
7/7/17, 12:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not really
7/7/17, 12:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That simply isn't true
7/7/17, 12:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Those nation's went on to be world powers of that time
7/7/17, 12:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a noble idea
7/7/17, 12:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And in future even I hope it to be truw
7/7/17, 12:19 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Kings in Saudi? Putin in Russia? Chinese Communism? Trump?
7/7/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's probably utopian
7/7/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: One world one government
7/7/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But utopian ideas eventually lead.to pragmatic toned.down solutions
7/7/17, 12:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even Rome and Greece had currotion and nepotism
7/7/17, 12:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even Rome and Greece had currotion and nepotism
7/7/17, 12:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No world will ever be perfect. But that isn't an excuse to accept the current system
7/7/17, 12:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not accepting
7/7/17, 12:21 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: And got conquered by barbarians
7/7/17, 12:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying
7/7/17, 12:22 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's well proven fact inter culture collaboration is more.productibe  than isolated same culture.ideology
7/7/17, 12:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's why all major companies whose sole purpose is effecincy at making money adopt that model
7/7/17, 12:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COLLABORATINV
7/7/17, 12:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's more than just a hypothetical utopian pipe dream
7/7/17, 12:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Trump is hardly that..China India conflict is hardly collaboration
7/7/17, 12:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: One bloody conflict
7/7/17, 12:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And so many collaborations that is holding the world
7/7/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That I agree with you!
7/7/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's why the current trends are concerning
7/7/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Trump, brexit
7/7/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Escalation of military skirmishes
7/7/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: All these are adding up
7/7/17, 12:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Something big is gonna happen
7/7/17, 12:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Or maybe I'm just a doomsday merchant
7/7/17, 12:28 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But I'm pretty sure that is not a crazy thought right now

7/7/17, 12:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And it's really difficult
7/7/17, 12:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Don't listen to Aniket much ok
7/7/17, 12:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Savage he is
7/7/17, 12:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He has very pessimistic views on girls
7/7/17, 12:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Maybe
7/7/17, 12:52 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm in the same category
7/7/17, 12:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I wish getting pussy was easier and not so.much hard work
7/7/17, 12:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Firstly. 

You are obviously looking out for a girl who is above your league

7/7/17, 12:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes otherwise it's no fun at all
7/7/17, 12:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In case of non hot girls you can get her by being a good human
7/7/17, 12:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But since a hot girl gets a lot of attention. You need to get her attention
7/7/17, 12:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The first rule is aesthetics. 
You need to have a good body. Shouldn't be a panda
7/7/17, 12:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The second rule is that you need something that she finds respectful. That can be money or power or the job
7/7/17, 12:56 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Being good and nice is likea non refundable ticket.to friend zone
7/7/17, 12:57 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: The others make sense

7/7/17, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I can prove this to you
7/7/17, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Many girls will have apparently unimpressive boyfriends
7/7/17, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *impressive girls will have unimpressive bfs

7/7/17, 1:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But very few impressive boys will have unimpressive gfs
7/7/17, 1:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's a testemant to the fact girls aren't picky like boys
7/7/17, 1:11 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I guess it's a matter of comfort zone and laziness..the guy who makes the most effort
7/7/17, 1:12 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Allows.girls to be the laziest

7/7/17, 1:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In essence. Hot girls get too much attention. 

They won't get with someone who chases her. She will want someone who she would have chased.

7/19/17, 7:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Get ready to be bamboozled for your 's world government, global homogeniety' idea
7/19/17, 8:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Before uttering this idealistic nonsense
7/19/17, 8:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Have you ever thought why there are nations
7/19/17, 8:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The very reason for the existence of political entities
7/19/17, 8:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not because, a certain people are of a certain culture, history, religion etc etc
7/19/17, 8:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not really
7/19/17, 8:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The existence of unity and cooperation in a state is
7/19/17, 8:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The threat outside of that state
7/19/17, 8:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Indians are United because we have external threats
7/19/17, 8:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any other nation for that matter
7/19/17, 8:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Global society won't be achieved by cultural technology
7/19/17, 8:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It will be achieved by an immediate danger outside the world
7/19/17, 8:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Namely 'hostile aliens'
7/19/17, 8:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Humans unite against a common threat
7/19/17, 8:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not saying global Co operation and peace is not humane and not possible
7/19/17, 8:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Rehne de this is getting too long . Milne k baad bolte h
7/19/17, 8:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In a administrative structure that is
7/19/17, 8:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: An
7/19/17, 8:20 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Socha hainnnnn.... Ye tumne kya kabhi? Aasma hain Nila kyu Pani pila pila kyu? Gol kyu hain Zameen?
7/19/17, 8:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre removed ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨
7/19/17, 8:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre added ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨
7/19/17, 8:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: @919920922667 you were saying
7/19/17, 8:30 PM - Kartik Vermun: @919422709999 that does sound convincing but do you believe that can be the only reason for a truly global society
7/19/17, 8:30 PM - Kartik Vermun: An outside danger ie
7/19/17, 8:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I wouldn't talk in absolutes
7/19/17, 8:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But yes humans only unite against a common threat
7/19/17, 8:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 99.99999999999999999
7/19/17, 8:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In absence of that, we compete
7/19/17, 9:06 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Nations are there because of kingdoms. Kingdoms because of tribes. Tribes because of clans. Clans because they acted as a protective family. It requires an entire clan to raise homo sapien children while we were foragers. We are social animals and cooperation, not competition, is our dominant trait.
7/19/17, 9:09 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I agree! Humans place self preservation and self interest above most things usually. They chose competition or cooperation depending on their self interest. While they may not act this rationally all the time. Usually human society has tended to move in a direction that has served the self interest of the species
7/19/17, 9:12 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: A global nation is just not an idealistic humane notion. It's also serves self interest globally. Eventually humans will be smart enough to realize that
7/19/17, 9:12 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: üòÇ
7/19/17, 9:15 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: The only reason it is extremely hard to realize is the 'law of inertia' or in other words the tendency of humans to preserve status quo
7/19/17, 9:16 PM - Kartik Vermun: Self interest maybe above self preservation
7/19/17, 9:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because of threats
7/19/17, 9:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You just missed my entire point
7/19/17, 9:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Threat is just a single stimilus for self interest
7/19/17, 9:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: There are many more and sometimes more important than threat
7/19/17, 9:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Greed and ambitions are huge ones for example
7/19/17, 9:26 PM - Arpit Saxena: The only reason we reached the moon was the cold war
7/19/17, 9:27 PM - Arpit Saxena: Now NASA says it doesn't have funds for mars trip
7/19/17, 9:29 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Humans are rarely rational these days, and very highly governed by feelings and emotions. The masters at the top use these feelings and create stories to manipulate people to serve their self-interests.
7/19/17, 9:30 PM - Kartik Vermun: Wtf @917407650530 back from the dead

7/19/17, 10:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kind of a win win for the police here
7/19/17, 10:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Though

7/20/17, 1:03 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a statement from the book haj. Right?
7/20/17, 8:19 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Sapiens. Reading it currently.
7/20/17, 8:52 AM - Kartik Vermun: Wow this book is really popular
7/20/17, 8:52 AM - Kartik Vermun: Another friend of mine on it
7/20/17, 8:58 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Ikr
7/20/17, 9:40 AM - Rohan Bhamre: We form nation to compete other nations, tribes to compete with other tribes, clans to compete with other clans and so on and on... Yes we co operate
7/20/17, 9:41 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But you are entirely missing my point.
7/20/17, 9:41 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Of course humans co operate
7/20/17, 9:41 AM - Rohan Bhamre: AGAINST A COMMON THREAT
7/20/17, 9:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I am talking about the level which ambikesh and I were discussing
7/20/17, 9:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: A singular global order
7/20/17, 9:43 AM - Rohan Bhamre: All of humanity won't cooperate like nation people in a nation do unless there is global threat or competition to humanity
7/20/17, 9:47 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Take India for example
7/20/17, 9:48 AM - Rohan Bhamre: All the mediocre people who give importance to caste religion or another community will be at each other's throats
7/20/17, 9:48 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But when there is a match against Pakistan sab bolenge Bharat mata ki jay
7/20/17, 9:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: That's probably a very crude example
7/20/17, 9:52 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But basically human societal institutions are structured to co operate WITH A COMMON GOAL.
7/20/17, 9:53 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Namely to survive and thrive against nature/other humans/ other socities
7/20/17, 9:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Have you seen the movie WATCHMEN
7/20/17, 9:58 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I guess you have point. Human beings are lazy and petty until under threat. Self interest too is governed by threat now that I think of it some of the time.

What do you think of expansionist policies though. The human thirst for wanting more and more does not involve threat. Can't that be a motive for unification?
7/20/17, 9:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Ambikesh
7/20/17, 9:58 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: No I haven't
7/20/17, 9:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: When I say threat I mean it broadly
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What I really mean is a common goal
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Like how climate change is getting countries tofether
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying we should think about other aspects too
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Go and watch this damned movie it's fucking amazing
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Kartik Vermun: Too long
7/20/17, 9:59 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Other than threat that can act as incentive s
7/20/17, 10:00 AM - Kartik Vermun: Gets boring towards the end
7/20/17, 10:00 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Certainly. The current arrangement seems very primitive to me as well
7/20/17, 10:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'll try it
7/20/17, 10:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking have to buy everything here

7/28/17, 4:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Holy fuck Satya I don't know what you mean by that but that's certainly not what I'm espousing
7/28/17, 4:51 PM - Satya: of course you don't, you don't have choice üëäüèø

7/28/17, 4:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you referring to rogue ai disaster? Cuz I'm not
7/28/17, 4:59 PM - Satya: automation, AI

7/28/17, 9:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anytime
7/28/17, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: does education make one an atheist
7/28/17, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: ??
7/28/17, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: okay how many of u believe in god?
7/28/17, 9:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
7/28/17, 9:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't believe in God
7/28/17, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Social institutions make you atheist
7/28/17, 9:09 PM - Kartik Vermun: what does that mean?
7/28/17, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 60 percent amreeki are religious
7/28/17, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: While Europe is hardly religious
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Kartik Vermun: maybe I get what ur saying
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Kartik Vermun: I went to a catholic school
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Kartik Vermun: daily morning prayes
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Arpit Saxena: No
7/28/17, 9:10 PM - Kartik Vermun: *prayers
7/28/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Muslims who get the same education are less likely to be atheists.
7/28/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Take many as an example
7/28/17, 9:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's because of their social institutions. Like mosques, local gatherings. 

Atheism in their society is frowned upon. In hindu society it isn't frowned upon. At least in the middle class Hindu society
7/28/17, 9:13 PM - Kartik Vermun: agreed , my mom and I have quarrelled over  this many times
7/28/17, 9:13 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Nastikism is one of the accepted Hindu ways of life right?
7/28/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Jains are nastik
7/28/17, 9:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Buddhist are agnostic
7/28/17, 9:14 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Lol!!
7/28/17, 9:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kartik bhul gaya kya. Manali me kitne baate kiye. Some one pointed out ashish daga. Apparently very educated and smart. And he believes in some nonsense like spirits in a cave
7/28/17, 9:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: BTW good initiative
7/28/17, 9:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Arpit Satya are hopeless
7/28/17, 9:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And read about Hinduism Wikipedia. It's portrayed very nobly :')
7/28/17, 9:40 PM - Kartik Vermun: Nahi be yaad Hai
7/28/17, 9:40 PM - Kartik Vermun: Was talking about the masses in general
7/28/17, 9:41 PM - Kartik Vermun: Daga can be an exception
7/28/17, 9:41 PM - Kartik Vermun: @917407650530 had pointed out BTW
7/28/17, 9:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not an exception. There are plenty monotheists in the science community
7/28/17, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Although much less in percentage than the general populace
7/28/17, 9:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
7/28/17, 9:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: lol
7/29/17, 1:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Check out Robert prisigs the art of motorcycle maintenance. It delves into why well educated people have such beliefs
 Gives a very scientific explanation. It's not random at all or not even exception
7/29/17, 1:11 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's just that Asians are more sensitive compared to Wes tern society
7/29/17, 1:12 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Part of that insecurity arises from them being developing nation's I guess
7/29/17, 2:14 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Western Muslims will also attack you if you paint Muhammad. #trueStory
7/29/17, 6:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I mean there are more conservative people in every religion. More so in Islam. I am sure many conservatives Christians would frown upon that too
7/29/17, 6:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Christian roots are in Western countries who have historically advanced more.socially.
7/29/17, 6:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Islamic roots are in Middle east. If it truly modernises I'm.surr it will become more liberal minded
7/29/17, 6:27 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think it solely boils down to replacing supertitious beliefs with rational ones
7/29/17, 9:26 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Christian roots are in syria
7/29/17, 9:26 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Islamic roots are in Arabian peninsula
7/29/17, 9:27 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What's this Eastern western theory
7/29/17, 9:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Go show this cartoon in Indonesia, you will be hanged by law
7/29/17, 9:35 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Aleppo Damascus and Alexandria were religious centre of Christianity. Just like rome
7/29/17, 10:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Well that's true. What I meant by roots in this context is where it flourished
7/29/17, 10:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Europe before enlighten ment would have hanged people too
7/29/17, 10:23 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's not an Easter Western theory
7/29/17, 10:23 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Islam is so totalitarian, it stagnates society
7/29/17, 10:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I just want to.point out that a society that has undergone a process of rational transformation is likely to be more liberal
7/29/17, 10:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Irrespective of religion
7/29/17, 10:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So is communism in n.koreaa. again it's not a problem of religion. The problem is regimes and people that use it as propoganda
7/29/17, 10:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: The same was true for Christianity during renaissance
7/29/17, 10:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Scientist s got hanged for  ridiculous things
7/29/17, 10:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know it's the cool thing to hate Islam but the religion itself is not the problem
7/29/17, 10:27 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: If you go back 400 years Islamic society was far more liberal than christianity
7/29/17, 10:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Look at the saracens
7/29/17, 10:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And compare that to the pope
7/29/17, 10:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's like blaming the symptom not the cause when people point fingers at a religion
7/29/17, 10:29 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Imho
7/29/17, 10:31 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Ultimately it's the people that control the propoganda machine who should take.the blame
7/29/17, 10:33 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw I have an Indonesian friend
7/29/17, 10:34 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Should show this to her üòõ
7/29/17, 10:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I have not even read any of the preachings of any religion thoroughly so would love to be corrected and know why Islam is any more restrictive than very orthodox christianity or hinduism
7/29/17, 11:11 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: A) Because of it's monotheistic nature and unwillingness to accept any god other than Allah.
B) because it's people have not challenged the head of the institution in the same way that Protestants challenged the Catholic domain thus allowing questioning
C) majority of people in Europe where Christianity culminated are atheistic or couldn't care much about it. US remains the last bastion
7/29/17, 11:41 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Christianity truly flourished in Europe under the Roman empire, then later colonialism to other parts of the world
7/29/17, 11:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And I would passionately oppose Christianity as well if it remained the same for fucking 2000 years
7/29/17, 11:44 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Well how many communist regimes do you see in the works today. And there are 1.6 billion Muslims
7/29/17, 11:44 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Well the cool thing today is apparently being a libtard.
7/29/17, 11:46 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Ghanta. They were richer and more powerful hence perceived more glamorous. Not liberal
7/29/17, 11:48 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Even I haven't. I just have read history. Who cares what's written in the books. What I care is what the people do.
7/29/17, 11:48 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Thats a new term
7/29/17, 11:48 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: üòõ
7/29/17, 11:49 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Sickular libtard blah blah blah
7/29/17, 11:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I still think blaming a whole religion is not constructive or valid
7/29/17, 11:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Too much diversity in it
7/29/17, 11:50 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: You alienate a lot of good.peopl e by putting labels
7/29/17, 11:50 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Where am I putting labels
7/29/17, 11:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: My purpose is to make the world realize, a huge Reformation is much needed in Islam
7/29/17, 11:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Obviously that's not my job. Muslims leaders can only do it
7/29/17, 11:51 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I agree with that
7/29/17, 11:51 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's too backward atm
7/29/17, 12:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's right
7/29/17, 12:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's right too
7/29/17, 12:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No. It's wrong
7/29/17, 12:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I mean not many religion s accept more than 1 god
7/29/17, 12:08 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Saladins kingdom was definitely more liberal than the papacy
7/29/17, 12:08 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's 1000 years ago now I guess
7/29/17, 12:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Saladin had to budge under the ulema
7/29/17, 12:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Especially when he took Jerusalem
7/29/17, 12:09 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Arabs were researing all the tech while Europe was in dark agea
7/29/17, 12:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They purged mutazilli
7/29/17, 12:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read about mutazilli
7/29/17, 12:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All their science was under the realm of Islam. It never opposed Islam
7/29/17, 12:10 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay will look that up
7/29/17, 12:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Averos who proposed secularism was ousted
7/29/17, 12:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their science was within the limits of Islam
7/29/17, 12:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rather their science was proving Islam and quran correct. Every theory of theirs cited that it was Allah that is the source of this
7/29/17, 12:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow they were just translating different books to Arabic
7/29/17, 12:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Most of their inventions were in engineering and architecture. Not in physics or astronomy
7/29/17, 12:12 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: All the Roman and Greek knowledge went to.arabs and then back to Europe
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They translated various Hindu books
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: They developed.techniqurs for navigation
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: From sanskrit
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Based on astronomy
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Chinese did it. They just adapted it
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Al hasn
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Is credited for optics
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Optics is again Chinese
7/29/17, 12:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: And navigation even by the western media
7/29/17, 12:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Islamic world was in the middle of the trade route
7/29/17, 12:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They used that to determine the direction of Mecca medina
7/29/17, 12:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence they had an advanced in this sense
7/29/17, 12:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not to build telescope to study space
7/29/17, 12:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me a Muslim scholar who said that earth is not flat
7/29/17, 12:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Advantage *
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a very apologetic theory propelled by media throughout the world.
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Come on man this dude was good
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Let's not belittle him that he did all that for allah
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They never apposed religion
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes one awesome dude Islam rocks
7/29/17, 12:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: There were many more
7/29/17, 12:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Did they?
7/29/17, 12:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me this
7/29/17, 12:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Who preserved knowledge of the Greeks and romans
7/29/17, 12:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It was a refined society
7/29/17, 12:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No one's belittling him. Tell me what did they use his theories for
7/29/17, 12:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Except this
7/29/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not saying it rocks or sucks. It's ideology today is antiquated but at one point in history it was the most refined part of the.world
7/29/17, 12:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And you think that's because of Islam?
7/29/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Navigation
7/29/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Scientific method
7/29/17, 12:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Optics
7/29/17, 12:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Charting of maps
7/29/17, 12:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Enlighten ment scholars followed in his footsteps
7/29/17, 12:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: He's credited as the forefather of rational enlightenment
7/29/17, 12:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or a rich empire which stood right in the middle of East and West
7/29/17, 12:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's my whole point. It has nothing to do with Islam
7/29/17, 12:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My point is they could've done much more if they separated religion and state
7/29/17, 12:22 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But sure it was part of his identity
7/29/17, 12:22 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: He was a devout muslim
7/29/17, 12:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Religious fanaticism at first glance as I read through
7/29/17, 12:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: True with any ideology be it religion, democracy, communism anything
7/29/17, 12:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No single set of beliefs can be the best way to move society forward
7/29/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But when you criticize Islam you attack people identity
7/29/17, 12:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not the smartest way to bring about change
7/29/17, 12:28 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: People are bound to get defensive and it will not solve anything
7/29/17, 12:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I never say this to Muslims
7/29/17, 12:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I meant the media debates and rhetoric in political sphere
7/29/17, 12:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying this to you so that you stop dodging problems that point to Islam so that the Islamic finally feel the pressure and start acting.
7/29/17, 12:30 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: True
7/29/17, 12:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But target those who are actually the problem there
7/29/17, 12:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Like Pakistan military honchos
7/29/17, 12:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Or extremist mullahs
7/29/17, 12:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Who find safe refuge in Pakistan soil
7/29/17, 12:35 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes our aim should be to isolate them from inside Pakistan too.
7/29/17, 12:37 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Turn public opinion against war and against the stupid dispute in kashmir
7/29/17, 12:37 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Need a Gandhi level leader.to do that
7/29/17, 12:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: GG
7/29/17, 12:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: WP
7/29/17, 12:40 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Indeed
7/29/17, 12:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think he is being sarcastic ambi
7/29/17, 12:41 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: My naivety and utopianism has no bounds
7/29/17, 12:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: HAHAHAHA
7/29/17, 12:42 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No shit
7/29/17, 12:43 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I mean I don't know the ideal solution. But there has to be better peaceful ways to resolve conflicts. I mean lots of people would have said ggwp to Gandhi
7/29/17, 12:44 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But he figure d out a way to do it
7/29/17, 12:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: To divide India?
7/29/17, 12:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think we would be a democracy without that route
7/29/17, 12:47 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It wasn't perfect by anymeans but he ended a 200 year Regine in a totally unseen way in world.history
7/29/17, 12:47 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No mean feat
7/29/17, 12:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Modi did it in Gujarat
7/29/17, 12:54 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: A lot of problems there are of India's.own making
7/29/17, 12:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All problems are always one's own making
7/29/17, 12:59 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I'm full y drunk now

7/29/17, 1:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I mean no disrespect to Gandhi but attributing end of colonial rule to Gandhi is a bit absurd? Idk
7/29/17, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi didn't cause independence
7/29/17, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was FDR, army revolt, internal destruction of Britain
7/29/17, 1:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ww1
7/29/17, 1:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 2*
7/29/17, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Quit India movement was utter failure
7/29/17, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Franklin D Roosevelt

7/29/17, 1:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wow ambi kiske saath piya
7/29/17, 1:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me it's ya girl
7/29/17, 2:50 PM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Yes. Learn to improve your judgement of character rather than stereotyping.
7/29/17, 7:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wait what is this about
7/29/17, 9:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf?
7/30/17, 12:34 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: There are sufficient Muslims who are not dicks, and all bhakts are
7/30/17, 12:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Mob mentality and individual mentality are different
7/30/17, 12:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Always note that
7/30/17, 12:37 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'll remember when I'm in the middle of a full scale riot
7/30/17, 12:37 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Then bhakts are my best friends
7/30/17, 12:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Individual choices and social choices more often than not diverge
7/30/17, 12:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem
7/30/17, 1:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZF5m-vmDzM
7/30/17, 1:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Saw this band yesterday
7/30/17, 1:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Friggin awesome
7/30/17, 1:03 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Moral policing üòõ
7/30/17, 1:08 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Not really. Just advice.
7/30/17, 1:14 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But who is judging and stereotyping?
7/30/17, 1:15 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: The world?
7/30/17, 1:16 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: US?
7/30/17, 1:16 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: UP?
7/30/17, 1:17 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: True. But it's always easier to put labels than to find constructive solutions
7/30/17, 1:22 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What labels? What are you guys even going on about
7/30/17, 1:24 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: The stuff Bhakts don't like to hear
7/30/17, 1:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I thought you disapproved of labeling and stereotyping
7/30/17, 1:31 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's ok. Go on pretending you have a higher moral ground and feel good about it.
7/30/17, 1:31 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That was an interesting read
7/30/17, 1:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Well speaking for myself, I don't care if about moral high ground s I genuinely believe Islam as a religion is not the problem.
7/30/17, 1:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And not an effecient way to solve the issur
7/30/17, 1:33 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Of terrorism sponsered by extremists of that faoth
7/30/17, 1:48 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Bhakts are stereotypes the same ways dicks are.
7/30/17, 1:52 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think so. It just hasn't got the stigma associated like some known ones but is stereotype nonetheless
7/30/17, 1:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Since it's used to refer to people with a certain set of beliefs
7/30/17, 2:01 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I was not even talking about terrorists.
7/30/17, 2:02 AM - Rohan Bhamre: That's the problem, we always let the lowlives hijack the conversation
7/30/17, 2:02 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The terrorists and the bhakts
7/30/17, 2:02 AM - Rohan Bhamre: When the discussion is not even about them.
7/30/17, 2:03 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And the elephant in the room remains. Defiant
7/30/17, 2:05 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: What's the elephant?
7/30/17, 2:11 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: <Media omitted>
7/30/17, 2:13 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Move on Muslim apologists, welcome Bhakt apologists!
7/30/17, 2:14 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Trust me the stigma associated with it is one of the vilest
7/30/17, 2:16 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay turning into a not so constructive discussion..thanks Shubhayan!üòõ
7/30/17, 2:17 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4

7/30/17, 2:20 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol. Ambi is still in Chester died mode
7/30/17, 2:21 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I'm traumatized
7/30/17, 2:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This discussion was not constructive.
7/30/17, 2:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It was like a Twitter troll war
7/30/17, 2:23 AM - Rohan Bhamre: This discussion yearned your presence
7/30/17, 2:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It's is actually a conflict of idealism and pragmatism. Rohan is more on the pragmatic side. Ambi and Shubhayan are tilted towards idealism
7/30/17, 2:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So this conflict will never be solved
7/30/17, 2:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Can you believe I still don't have a Twitter account
7/30/17, 2:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol
7/30/17, 2:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't either
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm thinking of leaving all social media except instagram
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Not me either
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Insta is cool!
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes photography is fun
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What about tinder
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Facebook is so useless now
7/30/17, 2:26 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/30/17, 2:27 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not too bad. Needs more people and depravity to be interesting
7/30/17, 2:27 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'm quite pragmatic at an individual level. Judge people on face value.
7/30/17, 2:28 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Because until I'm involved in policy formulation, armchair discussions are pretty useless
7/30/17, 2:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Chup reh chuitye. Hum kya hijde log h kya who judge people from their skin color, caste, religion.
7/30/17, 2:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's just friends talking about something greater than themselves. Of course it's useless
7/30/17, 2:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a past time
7/30/17, 2:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Is social behavior lost on you
7/30/17, 2:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Well people can only talk about stuff they have no clue about
7/30/17, 2:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's what makes it interesting
7/30/17, 2:30 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: I'm pretty sure hijde don't find such distinctions attractive
7/30/17, 2:31 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Cursing Shubhayan feels oddly satisfying
7/30/17, 2:31 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Plus it's not like I've said anything personal
7/30/17, 2:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw watching watchmen
7/30/17, 2:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Pretty good till now
7/30/17, 2:32 AM - ‚Ä™+91 99209 22667‚Ä¨: Not a fan of social behaviour

7/30/17, 12:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm kind of tone deaf but all the screams are one note right?
7/30/17, 12:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Crawl in in my skin these wounds will not heal and the next line seems like 1 note
7/30/17, 12:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lol it's not actually my bad

8/22/17, 9:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: which made their cities shit rich

8/22/17, 9:42 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm not sure if that wealth translated to free thinking
8/22/17, 9:42 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'll just have to do more research

8/22/17, 9:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Of course they do have influence s on it
8/22/17, 9:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: persian confluence is after the islamic conquest of persioa
8/22/17, 9:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: im not saying "influence"

8/22/17, 9:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: im giving them credit
8/22/17, 9:58 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Plus the Persian confluence overpowers the original parenthood
8/22/17, 9:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: you are giving them too much credit

8/22/17, 10:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: for all purposes you should be denouncing islam for assassinating cultures
8/22/17, 10:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: persians ko chodke islam has arabised most other peoples
8/22/17, 10:02 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's like amazon destroying retail stores in US

8/25/17, 9:50 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And it's all legal
8/25/17, 9:51 AM - Kartik Vermun: hmm judiciary system going social

8/26/17, 9:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Pointing fingers?
8/26/17, 9:45 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hard to distinguish between emotions with intuition/experience in many situations. I think people tend to justify the latter

8/26/17, 9:46 PM - Kartik Vermun: Emotions can act as triggers
8/26/17, 9:46 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Emotional decisions suck

8/26/17, 9:48 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well I wrote my resignation email at 3 am after downing Beer. The fact that it was logical may be attributed that I was in office at the time.

9/8/17, 9:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Serious research
9/8/17, 10:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is good
9/8/17, 10:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence, we must bat on our strengths. Where we are in top 20%
9/8/17, 10:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example I can't fight in top 20% in looks department. So I'll have to be rich and resourceful
9/8/17, 10:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So what's the difference in the genders' behavior that results in this skewness
9/8/17, 10:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't get you
9/8/17, 10:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why isn't it 80 percent females competing for 20 males
9/8/17, 10:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tinder is based on looks
9/8/17, 10:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Women have less emphasis on looks than men
9/8/17, 10:08 PM - Arpit Saxena: There's some theory of sexual selection on this, it's 20 80 in real life too
9/8/17, 10:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you playing pubg
9/8/17, 10:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: No
9/8/17, 10:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: Fed up
9/8/17, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men.
9/8/17, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Jayada difference nahi hai in male and female behaviour
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: That link isn't very scientific, he did it on a sample set of 27 likes he got on his fake tinder profile
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Amma khan ye larki log mard jaise select karte apne partner logo na
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Of course it isn't
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: I'm saying it's pretty shit
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: For the title
9/8/17, 10:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: I'm not saying it's wrong
9/8/17, 10:47 PM - Kartik Vermun: Studies done on such small sample sizes can make the impossible possible
9/8/17, 11:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Guys isn't it baffling that the largest religion in the world today started because a woman had to lie about her extra marital child birth
9/8/17, 11:06 PM - Arpit Saxena: ye
9/9/17, 3:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Marriage most foul: http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/marriage-most-foul/article19646124.ece
9/9/17, 3:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ¬†‚ÄúI earn ‚Çπ20 to ‚Çπ40 a day, which is hardly enough to feed my wife, six daughters, and two sons.‚Äù
9/9/17, 3:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If they are this poor, why do they get the idea of breeding like pigs
9/9/17, 4:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's their farz
9/9/17, 4:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
9/9/17, 4:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Having a child is the foremost duty for a momin
9/9/17, 4:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example if a muslim lady dies if she's pregnant; she has a direct entry to jannat irrespective of her deeds
9/9/17, 5:23 PM - Kartik Vermun: It's an old school mentality, when child mortality was high
9/9/17, 5:23 PM - Kartik Vermun: They used to have back kids
9/9/17, 5:23 PM - Satya: Backup
9/9/17, 5:23 PM - Kartik Vermun: Also more kids meant more support labour
9/9/17, 5:24 PM - Kartik Vermun: But yeah they never thought about how they'll feed them
9/9/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bhak be
9/9/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
9/9/17, 5:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do you really think they aren't smart enough to know that they cannot feed their kids, but are smart enough to know they can use their kids for labor
9/9/17, 5:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: These are factors but they don't explain the difference between the TFR
9/9/17, 5:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: See the image
9/9/17, 5:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I already know it
9/9/17, 5:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is their farz; huqum-e-huzur
9/9/17, 5:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Contradictory
9/9/17, 5:27 PM - Kartik Vermun: Okay, but what about peasants in states like UP Bihar
9/9/17, 5:28 PM - Kartik Vermun: Not many Muslims there
9/9/17, 5:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They still have lower TFR than muslims
9/9/17, 5:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There are
9/9/17, 5:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I wish

9/9/17, 5:32 PM - Satya: Not my theory, I was just correcting "back" to "backup" üòõ
9/9/17, 5:32 PM - Satya: **backup
9/9/17, 5:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Speaking of population in general
9/9/17, 5:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ooh

9/9/17, 5:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In 60 years you'll be seeing 30 -40 percent muslims in India

9/9/17, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Remembered ambi talking about gandhiji
9/9/17, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And how he attributed India's independence to him

9/9/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How big was the role of propoganda that led us actually believe that
9/9/17, 5:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: See the diagram
9/9/17, 5:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How skewed was our history education
9/9/17, 5:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Led us to*
9/9/17, 5:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not to belittle gandhiji or anything
9/9/17, 5:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My concern is historical accuracy
9/9/17, 5:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Can't help but feel gandhiji/Nehru duo were over glorified for a not so benevolent purpose
9/9/17, 5:44 PM - Kartik Vermun: Who did you think should be credited then?
9/9/17, 5:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not one person
9/9/17, 5:44 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah
9/9/17, 5:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But gandhiji and nehru overshadow other personalities by far
9/9/17, 5:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I would attribute our independence to the circumstances
9/9/17, 5:45 PM - Kartik Vermun: Gandhi is an international symbol now
9/9/17, 5:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Of the British
9/9/17, 5:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If that leadership were really in control of events that led to our independence, then the partition should never have happened
9/9/17, 5:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You are bhagwa
9/9/17, 5:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is RSS narrative
9/9/17, 5:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I care about the true narrative
9/9/17, 5:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What do you think is the truth
9/9/17, 5:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>

9/9/17, 5:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: Maybe Hindus and Muslims didn't want to live with each other?
9/9/17, 5:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Then why are there still Muslims in india
9/9/17, 6:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 1-2 million loss of life
9/9/17, 6:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Largest migration in the history of humans
9/9/17, 6:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All because these leaders didn't want to hurt "Muslim sentiment"
9/9/17, 6:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The doctrine of "dar ul harab" "dar ul Islam

10/5/17, 9:17 AM - Rohan Bhamre: 'analysis' lol this is literally gossip
10/5/17, 9:35 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes it's more like I.dont like this guy so I'm.gonna rationalize an related to a recent incident without real arguments.
10/5/17, 9:35 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
10/5/17, 9:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw an article about the history of Benaras
10/5/17, 9:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Speaks of falsification of history for propoganda
10/5/17, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: You need to stop doing this man. It's somehow very annoying
10/5/17, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And your analogies are worse!
10/5/17, 10:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: What? What's wrong in that?
The article author clearly seems to have an agenda against that Instagram star. He's formulating his opinion on gun laws based on this story. How is he not post -rationalizing? I didn't even use an analogy....
10/5/17, 10:37 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: The second PDF was something entirely else which you guys might be interested in...
10/5/17, 10:40 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: My point was that article does nothing to make a valid point against gun laws(there are many) but delves more into a personal vendetta. That's exploiting a tragedy rather than any solid argument. I'm pretty sure that was your point so I'm not sure why you are annoyed
10/5/17, 10:40 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Why do you hate him?
10/5/17, 10:41 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: The article author? I wasn't referring to Rohan here....
10/5/17, 10:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: No
10/5/17, 10:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Why do you hate Dan bizlerian?
10/5/17, 10:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: He didn't cover gyanvapi. üòÇüòÇ
10/5/17, 10:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't hate him at all. I just think that kind of rhetoric is useless and not based on logic. The point is about gunlaws. Attacking a Instagram fraud does very little to the actual problem
10/5/17, 10:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And takes focus away from what should be talked about
10/5/17, 10:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Okay
10/5/17, 10:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This article is biased
10/5/17, 10:46 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I agree
10/5/17, 10:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Why the hell did he not include gyanvapi?
10/5/17, 10:47 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I am trying to guess agenda here though
10/5/17, 10:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It's a crown of Islamic architecture in varanasi
10/5/17, 10:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
10/5/17, 10:48 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It focuses on Hindu hegemony and conveniently ignored the rest. Sounded suspicious. European version creating a divide though is nothing revealing though
10/5/17, 10:49 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/5/17, 10:50 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This temple is just beside kashi vishwanath
10/5/17, 10:50 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Mosque *
10/5/17, 10:51 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Beautiful it is üòõ
10/5/17, 10:51 AM - Aniket Awasthi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque?wprov=sfti1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque?wprov=sfti1https://maps.apple.com/?ll=25.311229,83.010461&q=Gyanvapi%20Mosque&_ext=EiQpGZEotKxPOUAxizidZKvAVEA5GZEotKxPOUBBizidZKvAVEA%3D
10/5/17, 10:51 AM - Aniket Awasthi: The mosque was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 CE, after destroying a Hindu temple.[3]:1 The remnants of the Hindu temple can be seen on the walls of the Gyanvapi mosque.
10/5/17, 10:52 AM - Aniket Awasthi: The demolished temple is believed by Hindus to be an earlier restoration of the original Kashi Vishwanath temple. The original temple had been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times. The temple structure that existed prior to the construction of the mosque was most probably built by Raja Man Singh during Akbar's reign.[5] Aurangzeb's demolition of the temple was also probably attributed to the escape of the Maratha king Shivaji and the rebellion of local zamindars (landowners). Jai Singh I, the grandson of Raja Man Singh, is alleged to have facilitated Shivaji's escape from Agra. Some of the zamindars were alleged to helped Shivaji avoid the Mughal authorities. In addition, there were allegations of Brahmins interfering with the Islamic teaching. The temple's demolition was intended as a warning to the anti-Mughal factions and Hindu religious leaders in the city.[5]
10/5/17, 10:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Islamic agenda conveniently ignored..
10/5/17, 10:53 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/5/17, 10:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see
10/5/17, 10:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I just knew this study was fishy
10/5/17, 10:59 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Because it blamed marathas?
10/5/17, 11:00 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Arey nothing wrong with your point. Just saying that sometimes your delivery comes off as arrogant to me. But that's just me üòö
10/5/17, 11:00 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf dude
10/5/17, 11:01 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Kya sochta h yaar tu mere baare me
10/5/17, 11:01 AM - Rohan Bhamre: üòí
10/5/17, 11:03 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I do not hold Marathas on a pedestal
10/5/17, 11:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
10/5/17, 11:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Okay
10/5/17, 11:07 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lol
10/5/17, 11:08 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw what's up with Europe?
10/5/17, 11:08 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Still on?
10/5/17, 6:03 PM - Kartik Vermun: Anyone wants to go to Singapore?
10/5/17, 6:03 PM - Kartik Vermun: Malaysia and Thailand also

10/5/17, 6:49 PM - Kartik Vermun: Cool

10/5/17, 7:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gg
10/5/17, 7:17 PM - Kartik Vermun: Is this yes or know or can't say?
10/5/17, 7:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
10/6/17, 9:22 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 9:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was a stoic
10/6/17, 9:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They always try to see the nuances
10/6/17, 9:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was pro suicide too
10/6/17, 9:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: So he believed in tolerating religon?
10/6/17, 9:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But not himself
10/6/17, 10:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Religion is very important
10/6/17, 10:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read Spinoza or neitzsche on it
10/6/17, 10:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket is a ruler
10/6/17, 10:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ruthless
10/6/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The death of God didn‚Äôt strike Nietzsche as an entirely good thing. Without a God, the basic belief system of Western Europe was in jeopardy, as he put it in Twilight of the Idols: ‚ÄúWhen one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident‚Ä¶ Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.‚Äù
10/6/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: http://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/what-nietzsche-really-meant-by-god-is-dead
10/6/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: His fear of the nihilism and our reaction to it was shown in The Will to Power, when he wrote that: "What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently: the advent of nihilism. . . . For some time now our whole European culture has been moving as toward a catastrophe."
10/6/17, 10:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Christianity has already fallen off in Europe
10/6/17, 10:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Today Europe has the best quality of life on Earth
10/6/17, 10:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't see any catastrophe
10/6/17, 10:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Pehle ki baat thi be Aniket
10/6/17, 10:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You're wrong
10/6/17, 11:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You are having a time lag bias
10/6/17, 11:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You are seeing a society created by the people of older generation
10/6/17, 11:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: the ones who are in their 40s or 50s
10/6/17, 11:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: THe death of christianity in absolute terms in europe is from last 30 years
10/6/17, 11:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Right now the situation in europe is
10/6/17, 11:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 60 percent of the births are outside wedlock
10/6/17, 11:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their TFR is about 1.8
10/6/17, 11:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Now you'll cite a few problems
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And concur that there's a disaster
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a major problem
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhai problems kab nahi hote
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't say that; their government says that
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Every age has different problems
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Problem h
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their families are destroyed
10/6/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lekin Barbadi nahi h
10/6/17, 11:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Can't you see the consequences ?
10/6/17, 11:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Institution of family is in peril
10/6/17, 11:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But that's hardly the fall of civilisation
10/6/17, 11:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why not?
10/6/17, 11:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not irriversible
10/6/17, 11:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Although some very pessimist people might suggest
10/6/17, 11:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And Europeans are being proactive about it
10/6/17, 11:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I agree that it is not irreversible; but it is not changing anytime soon
10/6/17, 11:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: European government has replaced husband with a state; now state provides for child care
10/6/17, 11:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their children move out very soon; single mothers are not very efficient in bringing up child on her own
10/6/17, 11:06 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think the death of religion is a more urban phenomenon in Europe. It still thrives in the rest of it
10/6/17, 11:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: NO
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rural areas bohot kam hain unke
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 80% of their population is urban
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: If it's similar to US that is.thats the case here
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: So I'm extrapolating to europe
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is said that about 70% of europe is non religious
10/6/17, 11:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: USA has 70% religious people; on the contrary
10/6/17, 11:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: USA pretty religious

10/6/17, 11:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Guys why don't Syrian refugees go to neighbouring countries
10/6/17, 11:14 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay what's the reason though?
What's the substitute for religion for community gathering in rural Europe?
10/6/17, 11:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All across Atlantic to usa
10/6/17, 11:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Europe also not that close
10/6/17, 11:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Lets finish this firest
10/6/17, 11:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: first*
10/6/17, 11:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ambi all these ages religion and culture have been so intertwined that most forget to see the difference
10/6/17, 11:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You don't need religion to have culture
10/6/17, 11:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Social life is ensured by culture
10/6/17, 11:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see. I guess go hunting or trekking instead of going to a church kind of?
10/6/17, 11:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like independece day
10/6/17, 11:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Zzzzz too long to type..
10/6/17, 11:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Already most of our social gatherings are non religious
10/6/17, 11:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The most important ones are though
10/6/17, 11:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But that's because religion had hijacked society for ages
10/6/17, 11:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rohan is highly parochial
10/6/17, 11:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: in his view
10/6/17, 11:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He talks sense as Nietzsche was saying
10/6/17, 11:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But his take is wrong
10/6/17, 11:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: European society me this is a watershed event
10/6/17, 11:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The next generation will be the ones who are grown without a family
10/6/17, 11:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
10/6/17, 11:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Europe has the best quality of life because it looted everyone for centuries....
10/6/17, 11:22 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I agree
10/6/17, 11:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A lot of people have looted other people
10/6/17, 11:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Keh di na libtard baat
10/6/17, 11:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You think Europeans were the only looters
10/6/17, 11:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They are rich because they knew what to do with the Duchess
10/6/17, 11:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Richess
10/6/17, 11:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No but they were the dominant looters who had the power to manipulate discourse and propoganda
10/6/17, 11:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not saying they weren't smart
10/6/17, 11:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They had the best business and industrial culture
10/6/17, 11:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's why they are at the top
10/6/17, 11:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Read the article. It debunks that mytg
10/6/17, 11:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: *myth
10/6/17, 11:25 PM - Satya: Anyone reading "sapiens" ?
10/6/17, 11:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read it
10/6/17, 11:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'll look at it
10/6/17, 11:25 PM - Satya: Good üëçüèº
10/6/17, 11:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/6/17, 11:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's correct but their version of how they got the riches is highly flawed
10/6/17, 11:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Afghans looted india for long
10/6/17, 11:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: kuch nahi hua unka
10/6/17, 11:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: They didn't have any inherent cultural Superiorty before colonialization. Industrial ization was a by product of it
10/6/17, 11:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: British used the loot for their industrialisation and innovation
10/6/17, 11:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rohan aaj bet laga le

10/6/17, 11:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: from 20 years you'll see the degeneracy in europe
10/6/17, 11:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Europe khatam ho gaya hai; wahan ye momin log rule karenge
10/6/17, 11:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Exactly what I was gonna say.

10/6/17, 11:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: BC mai kya keh raha tha!
10/6/17, 11:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Seem very politically motivated
10/6/17, 11:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Demographic time bomb ye hi hai
10/6/17, 11:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It is an annoying problem but I think it's unlikely they'll let it happen. I'm assuming there are smart people in Europe
10/6/17, 11:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe I'm wrong
10/6/17, 11:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are making efforts to rise the TFR
10/6/17, 11:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: by giving child support; maternity benefits
10/6/17, 11:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: etc
10/6/17, 11:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But the thing is that due to the fall of religion; there has been a sudden rise of individuality and nihilism
10/6/17, 11:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: so women are not preferring to have kids
10/6/17, 11:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I would not necessarily co relate the two
10/6/17, 11:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think socialism is the cause and not decline of religion
10/6/17, 11:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: fall of family structure
10/6/17, 11:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Japan me there is a very large welfare state
10/6/17, 11:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Still their families are intact
10/6/17, 11:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Haha I was gonna talk about japan
10/6/17, 11:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because their culture is very rich
10/6/17, 11:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No socialism bullshit
10/6/17, 11:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Japanese and Koreans have done westernization better than the West
10/6/17, 11:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: S korea
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Actually Japan tfr is lower even
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Look it up
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But that's because of their intense corporate life
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That is because of their economic problems
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is not due to rise of individuality
10/6/17, 11:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Japanese are very religious
10/6/17, 11:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: NO!
10/6/17, 11:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Please no aniket
10/6/17, 11:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Look it up
10/6/17, 11:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Please do not relate rise of the alleged 'individuality' (I don't think that's the right word for it, but anyway) with the fall of religion
10/6/17, 11:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think religion is falling of science
10/6/17, 11:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And then other problem is because of Marxist ideas
10/6/17, 11:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Japanese people have had very fluid concept of religion
10/6/17, 11:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Zen Buddhism and Shitoism
10/6/17, 11:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Majority of them do not identify with either
10/6/17, 11:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 60-70 percent are buddhists and 60-70 percent are shito too
10/6/17, 11:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bohot fluid hai unka religion
10/6/17, 11:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What about China
10/6/17, 11:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wahan 80% atheists
10/6/17, 11:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: but the surveys are very doubtful
10/6/17, 11:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: because people are forced to be atheists there
10/6/17, 11:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you want to be a member of CCP then you have to be an atheist
10/6/17, 11:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kuch log kehete hain ki 30% of china is now christian
10/6/17, 11:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Fong Gong has about 10 cr followers there; so the CCP is suppressing Fong gong
10/6/17, 11:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So people say that they are atheists in any survey conducted
10/6/17, 11:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fucking absolute government
10/6/17, 11:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: to avoid fallout
10/6/17, 11:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok so why aren't Americans and Europeans feeling scammed when Syrian refugees are coming to then
10/6/17, 11:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Them
10/6/17, 11:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'd feel scammed as fuck
10/6/17, 11:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Liberal parties their want to break the regional identities
10/6/17, 11:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: there*
10/6/17, 11:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm assuming the general procedure during crisis which displaces people is for the refugees to go to the nearest safe County
10/6/17, 11:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No muslim country is taking them
10/6/17, 11:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Exactly and why isn't the world taking about it
10/6/17, 11:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because they have bought the UN
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Saudi; turkey etc are NATO allies
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: they won't condemn them
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Pussies
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Man
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: and refugees are good for the liberal parties
10/6/17, 11:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: they want them there
10/6/17, 11:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: they want a pan national European identity
10/6/17, 11:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ambi bol kuch
10/6/17, 11:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Gn
10/6/17, 11:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: IS he reading?
10/7/17, 3:38 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I had to do a TA thingy
10/7/17, 3:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Interesting discussion. I am looking to read more papers about this now
10/7/17, 9:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Please don't. You somehow always come up with papers that have fishy agenda. I mean there are tons of paper telling two things about the same issue. For every paper you cite I can come up with a paper that says otherwise (if I dig deep enough). I think the better alternative is just to read neutral sources of history and then make logical conclusions by yourself. It really may be the safer bet
10/7/17, 10:11 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Modern politics has unfolded in a way that the academia is abused for political agenda. If you insist on using historical research papers for your analysis, you should round up papers of all the shades, read them up, cross check, compare and all that. But I doubt you do that
10/7/17, 12:03 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: There's nothing such as a neutral source though....
10/7/17, 12:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You'll have to filter it
10/7/17, 6:22 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Better to read well-researched sources than 'neutral' sources
10/7/17, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye sociology is farzi
10/7/17, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They do agenda driven research
10/7/17, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Same with history
10/7/17, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It depends on who funds them
10/7/17, 6:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
10/7/17, 6:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But you can make an educated guess about what is concealed through trial and error ;)
10/7/17, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haha
10/7/17, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Reading well researched sources was the base assumption
10/7/17, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Could you have pointed out what was concealed in this?
10/7/17, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There are "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns"
10/7/17, 6:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Provide input anyway
10/7/17, 7:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: The authors of research papers have a point of view and that often is visible in what is written. The good ones I feel are those that are willing to change opinnion based on evidence and not vice versa. Highly reputed research papers with thorough research are far more insightful than a non researched neutral opinion
10/7/17, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Input on the topic at hand!
10/7/17, 7:15 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's just a shoddy paper that smells of the pseudo intellectualism visible in Congress agendas
10/7/17, 7:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Weren't we talking about political agendas? Or do you mean religion in Europe?
10/7/17, 7:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Syrian refugees
10/7/17, 7:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why aren't neighbouring taking them and expecting USA and Europe to take them
10/7/17, 7:28 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Gulf countries don't take them. They have no policies in place for refugees since the world war. However they do fund them with quwait being the largest donor. The most number of refugees are still in neighbor ing countries 2 million in turkey and 2 million in Jordan, Egypt and Iraq. Jordan and Egypt don't have resources to support such an influx, hence the move to europe.
10/7/17, 8:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What's with the no policy for refugees
10/7/17, 8:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Europe ne convention join ki thee
10/7/17, 8:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: UN convention on refugees
10/7/17, 8:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 1951

10/7/17, 8:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: While these arabs are very tribal
10/7/17, 8:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They always see one tribe vs the other

10/7/17, 8:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: bond*
10/7/17, 8:47 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I have pretty close to an American accent now after 1 year
10/7/17, 8:47 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It makes communication a lot easier

10/7/17, 9:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Self-hatred (also called self loathing) refers to an extreme dislike or hatred of oneself, or being angry at or even prejudiced against oneself. The term is also used to designate a dislike or hatred of a group, family, social class, or stereotype to which one belongs and/or has. For instance, "ethnic self-hatred" is the extreme dislike of one's ethnic group or cultural classification. It may be associated with aspects of autophobia.

10/8/17, 5:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He is a participant who hosts the debate
10/8/17, 5:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Scam
10/8/17, 5:36 PM - Arpit Saxena: But how can u be this far right, he doesn't even acknowledge them as refugees
10/8/17, 5:37 PM - Arpit Saxena: He says Rohingya supporters are anti national pesuedo liberals
10/8/17, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lol
10/8/17, 5:37 PM - Arpit Saxena: As if all 40k are terrorist s
10/8/17, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's what you are concerned about
10/8/17, 5:37 PM - Arpit Saxena: He doesn't let anyone respond either
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I must say
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: His anchoring skills
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are shit
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He doesn't anchor
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He bullies
10/8/17, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Totally unprofessional
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: The hypocrisy is unreal
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What hypocrisy
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: He says people are silencing him
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Really
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: And then doesn't let anyone complete his argument
10/8/17, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: See that video na
10/8/17, 5:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhak be Aisa kuch bola nahi
10/8/17, 5:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Abe he did
10/8/17, 5:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: How is this the most popular English news channel
10/8/17, 5:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kab
10/8/17, 5:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I really hope when he says taking in Rohingya will be a security threat, you are not taking that to be him calling them terrorists?
10/8/17, 5:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: He says that Rohingya are a terrorist people
10/8/17, 5:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: I'll link timestamp holdon
10/8/17, 5:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ?
10/8/17, 5:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: 26.45
10/8/17, 5:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: It's similar but not the one I was referring to
10/8/17, 5:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: Dhundh raha hoon
10/8/17, 5:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Meh
10/8/17, 5:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Typical political narrative
10/8/17, 5:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Don't bother
10/8/17, 6:02 PM - Arpit Saxena: ???
10/8/17, 6:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'll take your word
10/9/17, 12:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Those production values are off the charts üòõ
10/9/17, 12:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Arnab needs to hire some graphic designers for his channel
10/9/17, 12:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What do you guys think about rap
10/9/17, 12:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I like a few raps
10/9/17, 12:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's poetry in a broadly
10/9/17, 12:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Broader view *
10/9/17, 5:11 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's an excuse for music
10/9/17, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any song with lyrics is poetry broadly
10/9/17, 6:49 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I believe guys like Mike shinoda and Eminem are poets. My friend here told me that her poetry teacher used Eminem as a reading assignment.
10/9/17, 6:58 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://youtu.be/npKCgowu-Bk
10/9/17, 6:59 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I do really like the rap and Rajasthani vocal mashup here. The rap lyrics are from the rapster's life story.
10/9/17, 7:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Rap is the most consumed genre of music in the us.
10/9/17, 7:11 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's not music
10/9/17, 7:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Just as F1 is not a sport
10/9/17, 7:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wait lemme process thay
10/9/17, 7:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That
10/9/17, 7:13 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's too technical, depends a huge amount on the car
10/9/17, 7:14 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Driver's skills and tenacity accounting nonetheless
10/9/17, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What do you mean by that though
10/9/17, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like it doesn't deserve to be called music
10/9/17, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or that by definition it's just a vocal delivery hence not music
10/9/17, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A style of vocal delivery
10/9/17, 7:16 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Rap in itself is not music, cuz as you said it is merely vocal delivery. Just words. It's the background that may make the genre be considered as music. Rap alone is not.
10/9/17, 7:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's like one of the most popular sport in UK after footy
10/9/17, 7:16 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's not a sport!!!
10/9/17, 7:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Why is it in the sports section of every. Website?
10/9/17, 7:17 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Plus one thing I consider for a sport is at an amateur level, is it an exercise?
10/9/17, 7:18 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Or do  you take the Indian governments stand here?
10/9/17, 7:18 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Like F1 at an amateur level may be go-karting, which is certainly no exercise
10/9/17, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Internet results suggest that it is indeed a sport
10/9/17, 7:18 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well even cricket is in there
10/9/17, 7:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: @14043680303 what you may try to mean is that it is not accessible. But that may not imply its not a sport
10/9/17, 7:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Those g forces are insane. Look at drivers after races and figure s on the calories burnt.. it certainly is an excercise
10/9/17, 7:21 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: At an amateur level? Go-kart?
10/9/17, 7:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Have you done go karting
10/9/17, 7:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yup
10/9/17, 7:21 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nopes, accessibility has nothing to do with the definition of sport
10/9/17, 7:22 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The cars are just way too decisive
10/9/17, 7:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Building cars is part of the sport
10/9/17, 7:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bet you didn't see it that way
10/9/17, 7:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: +1
10/9/17, 7:23 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's like saying Li Dan is world number one in baddy because of his superior racket
10/9/17, 7:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But badminton doesn't have a championship of rackets which F1 has- a constructors cup
10/9/17, 7:24 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: How does that matter?
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's a team sport
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sport is played between people
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Not cars :P
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: So is roboscoccer not sport?
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Same way military conquest is a team sport
10/9/17, 7:25 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Of course it isn't!!!
10/9/17, 7:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Arpit will be offended üòõ
10/9/17, 7:26 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Arpit will agree
10/9/17, 8:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The competitor in the sport isn't the driver. It's the whole team
10/9/17, 8:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Which in this case are cars
10/9/17, 8:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: BC itna broad. Life is a sport!
10/9/17, 8:04 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well if life is a sport, then F1 certainly can be
10/10/17, 3:33 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Talking of poetry though. Have you guys seen the lyrics of papercut by Linkin Park.

That part in the end: the sun goes down, I feel the light betray me. That's metaphor and poetry right there. Touches the heart
10/11/17, 6:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://youtu.be/Malh4flrFpk

10/11/17, 11:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: what a poet
10/17/17, 1:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: http://elegalix.allahabadhighcourt.in/elegalix/ayodhyafiles/honsukj.pdf
10/17/17, 1:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: 1. The disputed structure was constructed as mosque by or under orders of Babar.
2. It is not proved by direct evidence that premises in dispute including constructed portion belonged to Babar or the person who constructed the mosque or under whose orders it was constructed.
3. No temple was demolished for constructing the mosque.
4. Mosque was constructed over the ruins of temples which were lying in utter ruins since a very long time before the construction of mosque and some material thereof was used in construction of the mosque.
5. That for a very long time till the construction of the mosque it was treated/believed by Hindus that some where in a very large area of which premises in dispute is a very small part birth place of Lord Ram was situated, however, the belief did not relate to any specified small area within that bigger area specifically the premises in dispute.
6. That after some time of construction of the mosque Hindus started identifying the premises in dispute as exact birth place of Lord Ram or a place wherein exact birth place was situated.
7. That much before 1855 Ram Chabutra and Seeta Rasoi had come into existence and Hindus were worshipping in the same. It was very very unique and absolutely unprecedented situation that in side the boundary wall and compound of the mosque Hindu religious places were there which were actually being worshipped along with offerings of Namaz by Muslims in the mosque.
8. That in view of the above gist of the finding at serial no.7 both the parties Muslims as well as Hindus are held to be in joint possession of the entire premises in dispute.
9. That even though for the sake of convenience both the parties i.e. Muslims and Hindus were using and occupying different portions of the premises in dispute still it did not amount to formal partition and both continued to be in joint possession of the entire premises in dispute.
10. That both the parties have failed to prove commencement of their title hence by virtue of Section 110 Evidence Act both are held to be joint title holders on the basis of joint possession.
11. That for some decades before 1949 Hindus started treating/believing the place beneath the Central dome of mosque (where at present make sift temple stands) to be exact birth place of Lord Ram.
12. That idol was placed for the first time beneath the Central dome of the mosque in the early hours of 23.12.1949.
11. That in view of the above both the parties are declared to be joint title holders in possession of the entire premises in dispute and a preliminary decree to that effect is passed with the condition that at the time of actual partition by meets and bounds at the stage of preparation of final decree the portion beneath the Central dome where at present make sift temple stands will be allotted to the share of the Hindus.
10/17/17, 1:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This is ram janmbhoomi judgement by HC of allahbad.
10/17/17, 1:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This is the gist of the findings. 

Can anyone see the blatant demolition of logic in this?
10/17/17, 10:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What logic was demolished?
10/17/17, 10:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: @18144419636 it is now that you pull up an intelligent research material
10/17/17, 10:48 AM - Rohan Bhamre: By leftist scholars
10/17/17, 11:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: 3. No temple was demolished for constructing the mosque.
4. Mosque was constructed over the ruins of temples which were lying in utter ruins since a very long time before the construction of mosque and some material thereof was used in construction of the mosque.
10/17/17, 11:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Logically inconsistent
10/17/17, 11:05 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Temple tha bhi aur nahi bhi
10/17/17, 11:06 AM - Rohan Bhamre: They didn't say the was no temple
10/17/17, 11:06 AM - Rohan Bhamre: They said no temple was demolished
10/17/17, 11:06 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Ruins the
10/17/17, 11:06 AM - Rohan Bhamre: So what they said was not this
10/17/17, 11:08 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Okay I'll cite one analogy. 

You have an old home where you don't live. That house was in ruins. Some body constructed a house on that place also used some of the materials of that house.
10/17/17, 11:08 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Was it not demolishment
10/17/17, 11:09 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Moreover was that encroachment legal?
10/17/17, 11:10 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Legality of an act 500 years old?
10/17/17, 11:11 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Why not?
10/17/17, 11:11 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Because parties regarding the circumstances are long dead
10/17/17, 11:11 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Many rajas have their mahals built at that time
10/17/17, 11:12 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It is more of a religious sentiment rather than a civic legal issue
10/17/17, 11:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So if today I encroach your property and then I die. Will it make my act legal and close all doors for you?
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Your kids will live
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Have ownership
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Your private property will go to them
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Who was the temple owner be
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Rohan Bhamre: That idiot
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Ram lalla
10/17/17, 11:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Temples are owned by Gods
10/17/17, 11:14 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Legally
10/17/17, 11:14 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Thank God I'm not a lawyer
10/17/17, 11:15 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Then idk what is their reasoning
10/17/17, 11:15 AM - Aniket Awasthi: The thing is that my kids won't by punished. But your land will be restored to you
10/17/17, 11:15 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Does seem like an illegal encroachment
10/17/17, 11:15 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Building over a delapilated temple
10/17/17, 11:15 AM - Aniket Awasthi: ‚òù
10/17/17, 11:16 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Okay. Mai there purani zameen par kabza kar leta hun.
10/17/17, 11:16 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The thing was I was treating private ownership different than this
10/17/17, 11:17 AM - Aniket Awasthi: What is this logic?
10/17/17, 11:18 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's ok
10/17/17, 11:18 AM - Rohan Bhamre: We will settle this with ambikesh's source
10/17/17, 9:38 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: <Media omitted>
10/17/17, 9:38 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Here's my leftist source üòõ
10/17/17, 9:40 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw I'm a rightist in Indian politics. I support modi
10/17/17, 9:41 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Though not bjb cause I have seen firsthand the corruption of shivraj Singh Chauhan with my dad being Dean and State‚Äã medical exam controller
10/17/17, 9:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which party didn't have corruption?
10/17/17, 9:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which party so you think is more honest?
10/17/17, 9:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Congress?
10/17/17, 9:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't*
10/17/17, 9:45 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Sure but you would hardly support a party who has a bad effect on the health of a family member. 
Congress is even worse. But that doesn't make bjp acceptable.
10/17/17, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's true
10/17/17, 9:47 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Though I do appreciate the no nonsense get work done approach of modi. Wish more people in the party had that work ethic and capability
10/17/17, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: TBH for me there is no difference in Cong and BJP at karyakarta level
10/17/17, 9:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: These all facts were debated in Allahabad HC
10/17/17, 9:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I only like BJP better because I find their brass more competant
10/17/17, 9:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: These are the findings of the court
10/17/17, 9:48 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I agree. Karyakarta level is just lazy goons
10/17/17, 9:50 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know. I personally found their verdict quite logical. In the present scenario with a lack of clear cut evidence in favor of one, a decision for shared use makes the most sense
10/17/17, 9:50 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Maybe a cop out though
10/17/17, 9:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I just find symbolism(in the semiotic sense) stupid. It's always extremely transient. Pointless to have riots over it
10/17/17, 9:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Was have been fight over less
10/17/17, 9:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wars
10/17/17, 9:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fought*
10/17/17, 9:58 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: True. But it's quite fun to analyze how religious meanings are constructed in society. It's very similar to language. The same way no one cares about Sanskrit anymore, the meaning of religious symbols also changes and goes irrelevant very quickly.
It's hard to make a logical decision on events 500 years ago when the same structures probably had a whole different meaning.
10/17/17, 10:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's the structuralist theory in philosophy
10/17/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I find this illogical
10/17/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Very similar to this
10/17/17, 10:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because private ownership isn't the same as ownership of gods
10/17/17, 10:05 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Which property laws you consider though,the present ones or the one in the era of mughals? What is the legal one here
10/17/17, 10:05 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It seems very problematic
10/17/17, 10:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is utterly ridiculous
10/17/17, 10:05 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Mughals conquered it so does not the property belong to them?
10/17/17, 10:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: By this logic all the ruins today can be demolished and taken over
10/17/17, 10:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This is ridiculous
10/17/17, 10:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No
10/17/17, 10:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All temples today are owned by legit institutions
10/17/17, 10:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In mughal era there were lands for the Mandir
10/17/17, 10:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Agreed. Ownership by God is ridiculous
10/17/17, 10:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You people are parochial
10/17/17, 10:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It doesn't imply God
10/17/17, 10:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But the ownership is in the "name" of God
10/17/17, 10:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because when there's no samiti or care taker then the land is allotted to the gods
10/17/17, 10:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This system was designed by the British
10/17/17, 10:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When the civic law was formalized
10/17/17, 10:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I simply meant ownership should be in terms of objectively identifiable parties
10/17/17, 10:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Who will be the parties in a ram Mandir?
10/17/17, 10:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If there's no samiti or a guardian?
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I guess no one
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But that temple exists
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But a land has to be owned by someone
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In which case verdict goes to masjid
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lel
10/17/17, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: By your logic all the temples which are in ruins today can be taken over
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because they are under no one's name
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The land is of government
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If someone builds on it, it will be atikraman
10/17/17, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is not government land
10/17/17, 10:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You don't know anything about this
10/17/17, 10:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If it is a monument then only it is a government land
10/17/17, 10:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Else it is not
10/17/17, 10:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I never said I didüò≠
10/17/17, 10:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not trying to refute you
10/17/17, 10:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You should understand that this clause of "God's ownership" is just to plug the loophole
10/17/17, 10:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Else people will start fighting over the property rights of temples
10/17/17, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow. That thing apart
10/17/17, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I still find it very illogical
10/17/17, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because it acknowledged the presence of ruins of a temple
10/17/17, 10:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe because even you don't understand ownership relating to this case?
10/17/17, 10:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ownership ka kya farak padta hai
10/17/17, 10:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Think in common sense
10/17/17, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are saying ki whaan koi full fledged temple nahi tha
10/17/17, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: uske ruins the jo babri masjid construction me use ho gaye
10/17/17, 10:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well my stand is not unlike yours
10/17/17, 10:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What is your stand?
10/17/17, 10:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My stand is purely based on honour thinking
10/17/17, 10:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And inconsiderate of socio political scenario
10/17/17, 10:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Build a temple already!
10/17/17, 10:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But we both know that's not possible
10/17/17, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Honor thinking?
10/17/17, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Building a temple is a different issue
10/17/17, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: My say is that whether there was a temple at that cite before babri
10/17/17, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I am more interested in that
10/17/17, 10:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Let's assume credible evidence turns up there was indeed a temple
10/17/17, 10:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What then
10/17/17, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: nothing; just want to know the truth
10/17/17, 10:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kya nothing
10/17/17, 10:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's the bloody point of the case
10/17/17, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/17/17, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I know
10/17/17, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf
10/17/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't think the jury care much of the evidence because they already know they cannot give judgements that favours any side even by an iota lest communal tensions flare up some disaster
10/17/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So there's that
10/17/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't think their reports are any good source for truth or any meaningful scrutiny
10/17/17, 10:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I agree

10/20/17, 3:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's true
10/20/17, 4:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He is a decent guy though, judging from his other videos
10/20/17, 4:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What is
10/20/17, 5:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All the things that he said
10/20/17, 5:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "human embryo is like a leech" ü§£
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So?
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How does that validate his points
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It doesn't
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I was being sarcastic
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a typical "progressive momin"
10/20/17, 5:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Zakir Naik followers
10/20/17, 9:33 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: What do you guys think of scholarly peer review? Do you think it filters out prejudices in papers?
10/20/17, 9:51 PM - Kartik Vermun: What scholarly peer reviews
10/20/17, 9:52 PM - Kartik Vermun: The only reviews I've seen happening are done by the authors themselves
10/20/17, 9:52 PM - Kartik Vermun: To maintain the sanity of the material
10/20/17, 10:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Many reviews are just by their friends
10/20/17, 10:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I meant articles published in peer reviewed journals
10/20/17, 10:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Especially the popular ones
10/20/17, 10:01 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: How do they get by not being objective even after thorough vetting?
10/20/17, 11:44 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Refer well-respected journals
10/21/17, 3:00 AM - Kartik Vermun: https://www.facebook.com/sirhud.kalra/videos/10156691410238098/
10/21/17, 3:01 AM - Kartik Vermun: anyone this he's raising some genuine questions
10/21/17, 3:01 AM - Kartik Vermun: or a mere publicity stunt
10/21/17, 3:01 AM - Kartik Vermun: *anyone thinks
10/21/17, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He could wear a shirt
10/21/17, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
10/21/17, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He wanted to flaunt
10/21/17, 6:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: His photos. The Florence pic is epic. What an amazing town behind him. The architecture is so tasteful. Birthplace of renaissance indeed
10/21/17, 6:43 PM - Kartik Vermun: Indeed
10/21/17, 6:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
10/21/17, 7:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
10/21/17, 7:56 PM - Kartik Vermun: I remember we guys discussing this before, the scale of measuring men on wealth and women on beauty
10/21/17, 7:56 PM - Kartik Vermun: He uses the same in the previous video
10/21/17, 7:57 PM - Kartik Vermun: Aniket said this sometime as to how women loose value over time while for men it's the opposite
10/21/17, 7:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Which is maybe why we see all these men in late in their careers getting caught in sexual harassment cases
10/21/17, 8:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol
10/21/17, 8:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I said most of the women who don't invest in themselves lose their value
10/21/17, 8:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example models
10/21/17, 8:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Women who are smart and who work in knowledge industry. Their value appreciates
10/21/17, 8:06 PM - Kartik Vermun: So it's specific to show business then
10/21/17, 8:06 PM - Kartik Vermun: Or women making a living of beauty
10/21/17, 8:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Or women who don't do anything
10/21/17, 8:19 PM - Kartik Vermun: Do you think the opposite also exists, success women sexually assaulting men
10/21/17, 8:19 PM - Kartik Vermun: Or it's not in their nature to do so
10/21/17, 8:19 PM - Kartik Vermun: *successful
10/21/17, 8:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There have been a few cases
10/21/17, 8:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But they are really exceptions
10/21/17, 8:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Very few cases
10/23/17, 1:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hey arpit how did that find your article?
10/23/17, 1:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: *tharoor
10/23/17, 2:52 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Vivek probably sent out a lot of mails which eventually reached him
10/23/17, 11:08 AM - Arpit Saxena: Yes
10/23/17, 11:08 AM - Kartik Vermun: Cool man
10/23/17, 11:08 AM - Arpit Saxena: But Tanmay Bhat also found it
10/23/17, 11:08 AM - Arpit Saxena: Somehow
10/23/17, 11:09 AM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah pretty sensational topic
10/23/17, 11:11 AM - Arpit Saxena: It was made in quite a hurry though, we didn't try to get much data
10/23/17, 11:11 AM - Arpit Saxena: Should have made a better analysis with more data
10/23/17, 11:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Let that be a follow up
10/23/17, 11:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Here's an idea
10/23/17, 11:12 AM - Arpit Saxena: Usme itna interest lana is tough
10/23/17, 11:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Post it on arnab's fb page
10/23/17, 11:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: And tweet it to him
10/23/17, 11:13 AM - Arpit Saxena: Lol
10/23/17, 11:13 AM - Kartik Vermun: Not to pick up a fight
10/23/17, 11:13 AM - Kartik Vermun: But just let reality strike him
10/23/17, 1:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He has no Twitter
10/23/17, 2:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: Lol
10/23/17, 2:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: Abe he has
10/23/17, 2:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: I checked
10/23/17, 2:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Which one?
10/23/17, 2:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Is it verified?
10/23/17, 2:13 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm couldn't find it, I though tha
10/23/17, 3:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I looked at that work
10/23/17, 3:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It has a lot of loop holes
10/23/17, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: First being that he has nothing as a standard to compare with
10/23/17, 3:21 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yeah, we didn't have time
10/23/17, 3:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I have an idea
10/23/17, 3:22 PM - Arpit Saxena: Bata
10/23/17, 3:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I read a paper on use of AI on Indus Valley Script to obtain its ordering
10/23/17, 3:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.wired.com/2009/04/indusscript/amp
10/23/17, 3:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can use a similar methodology to find out the ordering and the use of hotwords, sensationalisation etc
10/23/17, 3:27 PM - Arpit Saxena: We could do it if we can get a transcript
10/23/17, 3:27 PM - Arpit Saxena: And a lot of other things eg. Arnab generator
10/23/17, 3:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Link?

10/23/17, 4:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ok
10/23/17, 4:33 PM - Arpit Saxena: Isn't limited to text, can be audio/images etc.

10/24/17, 4:46 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hey Shubhayan. Just wanted to ask how the hall mentorship program has been. Do you think it has started to help?
10/24/17, 4:50 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The allocations for the new batches have just happened. Waiting for all to contact their mentors for now. Will put in a short survey for the older mentees and mentors after that.
10/24/17, 4:55 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Big furore in KGP... If your measures are helping we can try it in more halls
10/24/17, 6:04 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I feel it would be great to implement it in other halls. I'll put out the survey for the older mentors and mentees this weekend.

11/1/17, 8:29 PM - Arpit Saxena: Wtf are those commenta
11/1/17, 8:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Radical atheists
11/1/17, 8:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I call it abhramic atheism
11/1/17, 8:31 PM - Arpit Saxena: How is it even remotely related to atheism
11/1/17, 8:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The page is "athiest republic"

11/2/17, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol
11/2/17, 3:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Waise they are bengali Muslim
11/2/17, 3:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They speak bengali too
11/2/17, 3:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rohingya is an artificial ethnicity
11/2/17, 3:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Arpit has this bias
11/2/17, 3:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When he thinks about these issues
11/2/17, 5:52 PM - Arpit Saxena: They are suggesting that they deserve whatever is happening to them
11/2/17, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's more on the lines of "waisa karoge toh Aisa hi hoga". It's a terribly insensitive thing to say just like Rajiv Gandhi's " when a big tree falls the earth shakes". But can we not let emotions hijack my original query. Those insensitive remarks may have some truth to it.
11/3/17, 3:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: would you be able to extract those creatures like that with your bare hands

11/13/17, 12:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: He and Neil de grasse are great too. Fascinating stuff
11/13/17, 9:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Neil de Grasse is too flashy.
11/13/17, 9:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: He says science is true
11/13/17, 9:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe he was talking in simplistic terms for the general populace
11/13/17, 9:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But isn't he incorrect on that one
11/13/17, 9:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Science is not true. It is the closest explanation of the truth
11/13/17, 9:46 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It at least looks for objective truths unlike philosophy
11/13/17, 9:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: In the "scientific method" we try to get the best possible explanation possible
11/13/17, 9:47 AM - Rohan Bhamre: You mean the most HONEST
11/13/17, 9:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Possible explanation *
11/13/17, 9:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Like even when testing hypothesis H0 H1
11/13/17, 9:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: We say that H0 can't be accepted
11/13/17, 9:51 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: The idea of more dimensions is so powerful. Got me hooked
11/13/17, 9:52 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The one thing I feel sad about dying is that I won't know more about discoveries about the universe
11/13/17, 9:53 AM - Kartik Vermun: Seems like saturation
11/13/17, 9:53 AM - Kartik Vermun: But isn't
11/13/17, 9:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's another powerful idea that you are just a line segement and time is an illusion
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So no worries about dying
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Kartik Vermun: If SpaceX pulls it off
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Kartik Vermun: Will be a milestone
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: You know
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: There's a simulated universe theory
11/13/17, 9:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: That we are a simulation similar to GTA
11/13/17, 9:55 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Please
11/13/17, 9:55 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's too cheesy
11/13/17, 9:55 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Agreed
11/13/17, 9:55 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They usually have their hypothesis on dual nature of light. Particle and a wave
11/13/17, 9:56 AM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah many have voided this opinion
11/13/17, 9:56 AM - Kartik Vermun: Comparing how games have evolved in the past
11/13/17, 9:56 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: The multiverse theory is pretty credible though
11/13/17, 9:56 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
11/13/17, 9:56 AM - Kartik Vermun: One day we won't be able to tell the difference between virtual and real world
11/13/17, 9:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
11/13/17, 9:57 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: There's michio Kaku video on that. We are pretty close to making inception a reality

11/13/17, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol
11/13/17, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Is hashish legal there?

11/13/17, 8:38 PM - Kartik Vermun: yeah I googled
11/13/17, 8:38 PM - Kartik Vermun: derivative of cannabis
11/13/17, 8:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
11/13/17, 8:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is said that ganja is native of Indian sub continent
11/13/17, 8:40 PM - Kartik Vermun: manali maybe the origin
11/13/17, 8:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What prompted you to say that though
11/13/17, 8:48 PM - Kartik Vermun: maybe he's smoking hashish right now
11/13/17, 8:48 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: This?
11/13/17, 8:48 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or this?

11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm not saying the effects of hashish aren't awesome
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hmmph more like homosexual üò§
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bhimbeteka. I went there today
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Kartik Vermun: u travelling aniket
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Homo primitus though art too :P
11/13/17, 8:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is from the Paleolithic times
11/13/17, 8:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No. It's near where I live
11/13/17, 8:52 PM - Kartik Vermun: üòÇüòÇ
11/13/17, 8:52 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nice introduction with the savage remark
11/13/17, 8:52 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Still draws better than me
11/13/17, 8:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I was discussing a topic with an anarchist
11/13/17, 8:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He says that Israel is the first terrorist state of the world
11/13/17, 8:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan do you agree with this?
11/13/17, 8:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is what people do after doing hashish
11/13/17, 8:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 8:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Silent crickets cricketing
11/13/17, 8:57 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Spain wiped out Latin America natives. Certainly a country of love and belonging.
11/13/17, 9:01 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But in terms of terrorist states, look up "reign of terror" in France by ruling Jacobins in 1794. They actually referred to themselves as "terrorists"
11/13/17, 9:01 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Terrorist state is a misnomer. Terrorism is the other side of the brutal power coin.
11/13/17, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: True
11/13/17, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Couldn't understand a thing
11/13/17, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe I need some hashish
11/13/17, 9:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf? Destroying the Aztec Empire and subjugating it's subjects is one thing. Wiping out natives is another
11/13/17, 9:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well Native population crumbled so it's looks like a yes
11/13/17, 9:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I really did not get your point
11/13/17, 9:17 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: States have been sponsoring terrorism for eons
11/13/17, 9:17 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Obliterated the natives of a continent
11/13/17, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Only central Mexico?
11/13/17, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or south America as well
11/13/17, 9:20 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: South too
11/13/17, 9:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's complicated
11/13/17, 9:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: More deaths were caused due to disease than direct violence
11/13/17, 9:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Most*
11/13/17, 9:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not a proper answer
11/13/17, 9:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The question was very specific
11/13/17, 9:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm assuming that by 'first terrorist State' aniket's anarchist accomplice was meaning 'the biggest terrorist state' and not 'the first terrorist state to exist in history'
11/13/17, 9:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Total anarchy to say first when you mean biggest
11/13/17, 9:37 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: @919422709999 well, you didn't follow specific answers.
11/13/17, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm just guessing aniket's friend isn't capable of using proper adjectives. Because claiming Israel to be the first terrorist state in history is too far fetched. So I'm just assuming he meant the alternative.
11/13/17, 9:43 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Bigger than.... Amrika?
11/13/17, 9:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well people hold all kinds of views shubhayan
11/13/17, 9:45 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Amrika has nuked civilians.
11/13/17, 9:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There's this muslim friend of mine who says Jews are illuminati
11/13/17, 9:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: HE MEANT IT
11/13/17, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And Jews have captured holy land and purged true believers from their rightful home
11/13/17, 9:46 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well, with so many enemies, makes sense to combine them into one
11/13/17, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And Jews have captured holy land and purged true believers from their rightful home
11/13/17, 9:46 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Trust me, being nuked is worse
11/13/17, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why are telling me
11/13/17, 9:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan is taking violence as terrorism
11/13/17, 9:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I guess
11/13/17, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking about anti jew perspective
11/13/17, 9:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Right?
11/13/17, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sigh. Texting sucks
11/13/17, 9:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or just my texting sucks
11/13/17, 9:48 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Violence aimed at intimidation to bend the knee
11/13/17, 9:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Imperialism
11/13/17, 9:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Assholism
11/13/17, 9:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Absolutism
11/13/17, 9:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Trust me I play eu4 ü§£
11/13/17, 9:50 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: That explains everything
11/13/17, 9:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Your texting
11/13/17, 9:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No doubt
11/13/17, 9:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: People have pataoed random bandis on the chat
11/13/17, 9:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fortunately I didn't need chat
11/13/17, 9:56 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Who are we implying here?
11/13/17, 9:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No one
11/13/17, 9:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Rest assured
11/13/17, 9:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A few friends
11/13/17, 9:57 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: @918348664817 , @918101459296 there's still hope in chat üòé
11/13/17, 9:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No one from this group
11/13/17, 9:58 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: @917407650530 there's still hope in chatbots  üòé
11/13/17, 9:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You know if I and Anuja ever breakup, I really don't trust I could ever gather more patience and zeal to court a girl
11/13/17, 10:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Too much energy in an otherwise easy process
11/13/17, 10:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Girls are too demanding
11/13/17, 10:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I want this I want that
11/13/17, 10:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You are lazy
11/13/17, 10:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But you're right
11/13/17, 10:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Touche
11/13/17, 10:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I was talking in terms of principles
11/13/17, 10:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm liking the arranged marriage system more and more
11/13/17, 10:04 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah. Here the guy can say "I want this and I want that"
11/13/17, 10:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No?
11/13/17, 10:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You think girls family don't have requirements at all?
11/13/17, 10:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And besides it's not an expectation from an individual. It's a filter they apply on numerous candidates
11/13/17, 10:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So please.
11/13/17, 10:05 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: You're right texting sucks
11/13/17, 10:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe you're texting sucks as well
11/13/17, 10:06 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sarcasm and repartee are lost
11/13/17, 10:06 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Maybe that's just you
11/13/17, 10:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
11/13/17, 10:07 PM - Kartik Vermun: shubhayan and rohan , when r u guys getting married then ?

11/13/17, 10:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: what questions ?
11/13/17, 10:08 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Others just wanna get laid. Marriage is not on their minds.

11/13/17, 10:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And not necessarily with your laider for the lack of a better word
11/13/17, 10:09 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Laidy?

11/13/17, 10:16 PM - Kartik Vermun: ü§î
11/13/17, 10:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Arranged marriage is really good yaar. The world doesn't give enough credit to India for this
11/13/17, 10:17 PM - Kartik Vermun: There a new concept of arranged love
11/13/17, 10:18 PM - Kartik Vermun: Or not new

11/13/17, 10:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How's tanushree
11/13/17, 10:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Romanticism is very new
11/13/17, 10:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just 200 years
11/13/17, 10:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Prior to that love and marriage were different
11/13/17, 10:21 PM - Kartik Vermun: When I read this I thought this was a personal statement
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Kartik Vermun: About your some new relationship
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In general
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket and his adventures
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Kartik Vermun: Bata be
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Kartik Vermun: Adventures
11/13/17, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Romanticism has merged marriage and love
11/13/17, 10:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The thing that you can find love and a companion in a same person
11/13/17, 10:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So arranged marriage was not looked down upon earlier
11/13/17, 10:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I I thought is was ayushi and not tanushree. Am I behind on this?
11/13/17, 10:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ü§£ü§£ü§£
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wild Ambi appears
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's like a sniffer
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Always talks to the point
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey we used to call ambikesh 'guy'
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Had almost forgotten
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait, even I thought it was Aayushi
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is Aayushi
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What?
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You all know about Ayushi
11/13/17, 10:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Then who is Tanushree?
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket told me to keep it a secret
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tanushree is "whiskey and a teacup"
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Hahahahahhahahahah
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Whiskey in a teacup *
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's what her bio says
11/13/17, 10:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait, so there is a real Tanushree?
11/13/17, 10:30 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Old Indori friend?
11/13/17, 10:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's funny
11/13/17, 10:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I asked aniket how tanushree is and everyone else except Aniket commented
11/13/17, 10:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Men
11/13/17, 10:31 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Women too
11/13/17, 10:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I also commented
11/13/17, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: After heavy public pressure
11/13/17, 10:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tanushree is an Indori fried
11/13/17, 10:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Friend *

11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Tanushree is a girl who I thought looked hot at first glance. But as we spoke and the more I looked at her pictures the more not so hot looking she got
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I learnt that I am incredibly shallow
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Me too
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm deep üòé
11/13/17, 10:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But rohan you have a long term girlfriend
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you were shallow you would have had many
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't think you're shallo
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because as she got not so hot I lost a lot of my will to keep her entertained
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shallow
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Total
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Men
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Happens
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Happened with me too
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Me too
11/13/17, 10:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Thanks man‚ò∫
11/13/17, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Men are not meant for monogamy
11/13/17, 10:35 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: So Soni is the one who dated everyone?
11/13/17, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
11/13/17, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But now she's good
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's the best I feel
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: She has matured
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Monogamy?
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: And you're semi-seeing her?
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Monogamy is important for our modern society
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
11/13/17, 10:37 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Wait... What are these images?
11/13/17, 10:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Think again @14043680303
11/13/17, 10:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ottoman harem
11/13/17, 10:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Say this again now
11/13/17, 10:37 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I resist downloading these temptations
11/13/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why?. They are very tasteful paintings
11/13/17, 10:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are royal concubines
11/13/17, 10:38 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Monogamy is the best
11/13/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It doesn't have to be about base sex
11/13/17, 10:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But a sophisticated sensual art
11/13/17, 10:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I believe people should be able to appreciate this without being associated to adultery
11/13/17, 10:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What prevents us from this is sex stigma
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's primitive and it sucks!
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It weakens the will
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What will
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This is exactly what I'm talking about
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: And makes us less entertaining to our gfs
11/13/17, 10:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is an Abhramic thought. Which associated sex as a taboo
11/13/17, 10:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't get you. Elucidate
11/13/17, 10:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Haha the corner of my eye read it ejaculate
11/13/17, 10:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes I'm suit
11/13/17, 10:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Silly*
11/13/17, 10:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haha
11/13/17, 10:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you remember a word that ambi wrote on Facebook while he was preparing for GRE? @18144419636
11/13/17, 10:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: TIL that Sikhs in the Sikh Empire only comprised of 17 percent of the population
11/13/17, 10:43 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: makes us less entertaining towards our gfs
11/13/17, 10:44 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Ok got class bbye!
11/13/17, 10:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bye
11/13/17, 10:44 PM - Kartik Vermun: Bye
11/13/17, 10:45 PM - Kartik Vermun: Nice to know about your love lives
11/13/17, 10:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Monogamy makes our gfs less entertaining to us over time too
11/13/17, 10:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ,?
11/13/17, 10:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye kahan se aaya?
11/13/17, 10:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Idk
11/13/17, 10:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Was reading Sikh history
11/13/17, 10:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India me ruling is based on castes
11/13/17, 10:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You have to gain favour of leaders of dominant caste groups
11/13/17, 10:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even shivaji did so
11/13/17, 10:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Then after that bajirao gained support of bhosle shindey dhangars
11/13/17, 10:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Military history of Sikhs is a testament to the atrocities of Muslim rulers in India
11/13/17, 10:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shivajis too
11/13/17, 10:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sikhs became what Hindu Kshatriyas failed to be
11/13/17, 10:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs are over exaggerated. I'm not denying their contributions but I think that others also played significant roles
11/13/17, 10:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Contribution to what?
11/13/17, 10:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Against Muslim atrocities
11/13/17, 10:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't think Hindus suffered Muslim atrocities.
11/13/17, 10:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I mean like human disaster level
11/13/17, 10:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The way Sikhs did
11/13/17, 10:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hindus made agreements with Muslims
11/13/17, 10:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You're wrong
11/13/17, 10:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Muslim rulers
11/13/17, 10:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs were a small group
11/13/17, 10:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They were
11/13/17, 10:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Similar not all Hindu groups make peace with Mughals
11/13/17, 10:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can't compare 4 percent population with 60 percent population
11/13/17, 10:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even in Hindus you can find 4 percent Hindus
11/13/17, 10:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Contributions of ahoms are as significant as Sikhs
11/13/17, 10:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Similarly contributions of orriya
11/13/17, 10:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: For orriya it wasn't about religion
11/13/17, 10:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Nobody went there
11/13/17, 10:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even Marathas didn't
11/13/17, 10:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
11/13/17, 10:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's not like that

11/13/17, 10:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was the sena pati of ahoms
11/13/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs are over exaggerated because they were supporting the British
11/13/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: British called them the martial race
11/13/17, 10:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It was a major regional power
11/13/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence they got supreme positions in army and civil services
11/13/17, 10:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Also Sikhs have a major influence on Delhi hence their history is well taught
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No that's because after 1857 mutiny British suppressed Hindu and Muslim in army ranks
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Other's history is forgotten
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes.
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even before that
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sikhs were in good equation with British till 1848
11/13/17, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They even helped in getting sindh
11/13/17, 10:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I just liked their principles

12/23/17, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/23/17, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The concept of nation
12/23/17, 9:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So yeah
12/23/17, 9:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That was only for Germany dude
12/23/17, 9:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For Europe
12/23/17, 9:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: For Germany
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Don't call England as a nation
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Or France
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why not
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Before Westphalia
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because they were not really United under one political rule
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: English and French Kingdom existed way before that
12/23/17, 9:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They were fighting with Scotland
12/23/17, 9:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nation is not the same as kingdom
12/23/17, 9:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok let me tell you

12/23/17, 9:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lemme give an example
12/23/17, 9:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: @14043680303
12/23/17, 9:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do you know Austrian Hungarian state existed
12/23/17, 9:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Aise to holy Roman empire bhi tha
12/23/17, 9:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because both the kingdoms were ruled by the same king
12/23/17, 9:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Then why not call them the same Kingdom
12/23/17, 9:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because Austria and Hungary were different nations of different peoplee
12/23/17, 9:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Peoples
12/23/17, 9:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/23/17, 9:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Austrian Kingdom Hungarian Bohemia Poland Lithuania Croatia serbia
12/23/17, 9:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I can go on
12/23/17, 9:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: These nations have been existing for more than thousand yes
12/23/17, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Peace of West philia was a watershed event
12/23/17, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because nations recognized each other
12/23/17, 9:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok which treaty are you taking
12/23/17, 9:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Taking about
12/23/17, 9:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Talking
12/23/17, 9:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Exactly
12/23/17, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia?wprov=sfti1
12/23/17, 9:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok so religious wars
12/23/17, 9:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Although many other nations were involved
12/23/17, 9:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because of political reasons
12/23/17, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Some of the principles developed at Westphalia, especially those relating to respecting the boundaries of sovereign states and non-interference in their domestic affairs, became central to the world order that developed over the following centuries, and remain in effect today. In several parts of the world, however, sovereign states emerged from what was once imperial territory only after the post-World War II period of decolonization.[6] More significantly, one of major principles‚Äîthe balance of power‚Äîwas undermined in the Twentieth century. Referring to the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler said that without Wehrmacht, a "wave would have swept over Europe that would have taken no care of the ridiculous British idea of the balance of power in Europe in all its banality and stupid tradition‚Äîonce and for all."
12/23/17, 9:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But in sentiment that episode only revolved around German people
12/23/17, 9:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nation states can't exist until there is a mutual recognition of rights
12/23/17, 9:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's what I am saying
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm just saying that it was a watershed event
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Also I have been wondering
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty?wprov=sfti1
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye Sahi hai
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Indian freedom struggle
12/23/17, 9:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Have a look
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What about it?
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think Indian freedom struggle was shabby as fuck
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Very uncoordinated
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇüòÇ
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/23/17, 9:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And I think it's taught to us wrong in our schools
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: History books just teach glorification of congress
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It wasn't a revolution at all to me
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's it
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It wasn't
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India was the most peaceful colonies of British
12/23/17, 9:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They delegated least amount of troops for law and order in india per capita
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Other territories were far more unstable
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like let's say about a common man in British India
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'd say 4 out of 5 commoners wouldn't give a fuck about freedom struggle
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe 3
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lul
12/23/17, 9:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What would you say
12/23/17, 9:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/23/17, 9:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was an elitist movement
12/23/17, 9:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Till 1930
12/23/17, 9:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Then it became communal
12/23/17, 9:31 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Khilafat started in 1919. What Indian leaders thought to use as a tool to unite the masses ended up being used by the Brits to break the masses.
12/23/17, 9:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yeah this as well
12/23/17, 9:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think this is another meme sold to us by our history books
12/23/17, 9:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: "British divided Hindu Muslim!"
12/23/17, 9:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like yeah we were fucking kids
12/23/17, 9:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *like we were kids
12/23/17, 9:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I do not know about this
12/23/17, 9:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are your sure
12/23/17, 9:46 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: They might have added to the polarization
12/23/17, 9:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bwhaha
12/23/17, 9:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kuch bhi Shubhayan
12/23/17, 9:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I vehemently disagree with this thought
12/23/17, 9:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I hope you know the principles behind khilafat movement
12/23/17, 9:58 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: You don't feel that Khilafat movement was used to convert religious sentiments into nationalist ones?
12/23/17, 10:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's a hogwash
12/23/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In swadeshi movement. Mainly Hindus participated
12/23/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: As Bengal partition was anti Hindu
12/23/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And pro Muslims
12/23/17, 10:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India was always communal
12/23/17, 10:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There was no solidarity among religious masses
12/23/17, 10:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Swarajya*
12/23/17, 10:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I meant swadeshi movement. Swarajya was the demand by lokmanya tilak
12/23/17, 10:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 1905 wala swadeshi movement
12/23/17, 10:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fuck I need to read Indian freedom struggle again
12/23/17, 10:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or some one make a grand strategy game on it. it's much easier to remember that warüò¨
12/23/17, 10:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Exactly
12/23/17, 10:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Stop blaming it on British
12/23/17, 10:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Today we are blaming our politicians!
12/23/17, 10:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: LUL

12/23/17, 10:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They used the already existing fault line
12/23/17, 10:26 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The politicisation of communality. Who started it first, the Brits or us?
12/23/17, 10:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Us
12/23/17, 10:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kings use to use this communal agenda all the time

12/23/17, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: To aurangzeb
12/23/17, 10:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: This was good feed
12/23/17, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ummm Muslim league?
12/23/17, 10:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That is, if you are referring to the events that led to the partition
12/23/17, 10:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I may be wing
12/23/17, 10:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wrong
12/23/17, 10:33 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Just referring to introducing religion into Indian Freedom struggle
12/23/17, 10:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What was that about though
12/23/17, 10:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was always there
12/23/17, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India is intertwined with religion
12/23/17, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was more so 150 years ago
12/23/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In swadeshi movement people use to take bath in ganga before going for the protest
12/23/17, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even today the war chants of various regiments in the army is "Har Har mahadev"
12/23/17, 10:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bande matram was the song used for the protest. Bande matram is pretty religious in a way
12/23/17, 10:37 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: "The Next Sketch shows Shivaji dictating his famous letter to Aurangzeb protesting against the imposition of¬†Jaziya¬†on the Hindus (2nd April 1679).

12/24/17, 9:15 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No academic courses at least in my University. There is an atheist agnostic association (AAA) which has decent membership but that's about it. Pennsylvania is a pretty conservative state though.
12/24/17, 9:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: One of her advisors is a neurologist from the biology department. She has a bunch of psychoanalytical maps of the brain of which portions are active during thoughts of religious divergence/hate. One of the premises is that religious hatred/dislikes most acute ly develop in ages between 6 to 14.
12/24/17, 9:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: If it's ingrained in that age there is a 75% chance that the person is likely to chose religious bias over objective logic in such scenarios at an older age

2/21/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ‚ÄúThe Law of Religion

IN THE MEDIEVAL MARKET IN SAMARKAND, a city built on a Central Asian oasis, Syrian merchants ran their hands over fine Chinese silks, fierce tribesmen from the steppes displayed the latest batch of straw-haired slaves from the far west, and shopkeepers pocketed shiny gold coins imprinted with exotic scripts and the profiles of unfamiliar kings. Here, at one of that era‚Äôs major crossroads between east and west, north and south, the unification of humankind was an everyday fact. The same process could be observed at work when Kublai Khan‚Äôs army mustered to invade Japan in 1281. Mongol cavalrymen in skins and furs rubbed shoulders with Chinese foot soldiers in bamboo hats, drunken Korean auxiliaries picked fights with tattooed sailors from the South China Sea, engineers from Central Asia listened with dropping jaws to the tall tales of European adventurers, and all obeyed the command of a single emperor.
Meanwhile, around the holy Ka‚Äôaba in Mecca, human unification was proceeding by other means. Had you been a pilgrim to Mecca, circling Islam‚Äôs holiest shrine in the year 1300, you might have found yourself in the company of a party from Mesopotamia, their robes floating in[‚Ä¶]‚Äù

3/27/18, 3:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wasn't following much politics back then
3/27/18, 9:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: https://youtu.be/sULM8__SBoE
3/27/18, 9:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Nostalgia anyone?

4/2/18, 9:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Assuming the subtitles are accurate
4/2/18, 9:15 PM - Kartik Vermun: The anchor seems really excited
4/2/18, 9:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I remember talking to a friend about god
4/2/18, 9:16 PM - Kartik Vermun: And
4/2/18, 9:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He asked me can u prove God doesn't exist
4/2/18, 9:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's impossible
4/2/18, 9:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Level of indoctrination is so high in society.
4/2/18, 9:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even in 21 century
4/2/18, 9:17 PM - Kartik Vermun: It gives people comfort
4/2/18, 9:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No doubt
4/2/18, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In the mediaeval times
4/2/18, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We don't need lies to comfort ourselves anymore
4/2/18, 9:18 PM - Kartik Vermun: People will resort to anything
4/2/18, 9:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *till premodern

4/3/18, 12:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The internet is a deep and dark space
4/3/18, 12:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Be careful friends
4/3/18, 1:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok I was wondering why Aniket wasn't chiming in on any of this. Turns out internet suspended in his area due to dalit protests!

4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Kartik Vermun: One day without internet
4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Kartik Vermun: Must have had some deep introspection
4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It involved a lot of introspection. You should try it
4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Kartik Vermun: Exactly
4/3/18, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Discovered a lot of old hobbies

4/3/18, 8:38 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Nice!
4/3/18, 8:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Internet

4/3/18, 8:39 PM - Kartik Vermun: Smartphone to Hai na
4/3/18, 8:39 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I mean for me my main anti social time Leach was DotA.
4/3/18, 8:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dota is dead
4/3/18, 8:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's losing players every week now
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: You remember when I told you that in mess 2 years back
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: You guys didn't believe me
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket that's not how statistics work
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I was wrong to say that dota will remain attractive
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Didn't expect that from you Aniket
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Kartik Vermun: Didn't openai beat it last year
4/3/18, 8:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Zero statistics
4/3/18, 8:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Absolutely mediocre statistical inference
4/3/18, 8:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I told you. Dota is officially losing players every week
4/3/18, 8:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do you expect it to grow indefinitely
4/3/18, 8:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The trend is downwards except the times, they release a new update
4/3/18, 8:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even pubg is losing players every week
4/3/18, 8:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse not; i expected it to maintain a saturation level
4/3/18, 8:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Would you call pubg dying
4/3/18, 8:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Net loss;
4/3/18, 8:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: From when did it start losing players
4/3/18, 8:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think there hasn't been enough time from that to deduce thus trend
4/3/18, 8:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This*
4/3/18, 8:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
4/3/18, 8:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: THis has been a trend since at least 6 months now
4/3/18, 8:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think unless TI declines for 2 years it's not convincing to say DotA is dying
4/3/18, 8:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
4/3/18, 8:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
4/3/18, 8:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not challenging that
4/3/18, 8:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: dying doesn't mean dead
4/3/18, 8:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I have shown you the data too now
4/3/18, 8:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: By dying I mean dying
4/3/18, 8:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why do you say that it's not dying?
4/3/18, 8:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: Someone made an analysis on reddit that dota is on maintenance part of its life, not growth
4/3/18, 8:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's temporary decline
4/3/18, 8:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The length and rate isn't convincing to call it dying
4/3/18, 8:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: And valve is taking steps  to retain users eg. Dota plus for long term income
4/3/18, 8:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: Counter strike is old but not dead
4/3/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It takes DotA for this fucker to speak in this group
4/3/18, 8:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 20% decline from the peak
4/3/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: DotA isn't just players
4/3/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's tournaments n shit
4/3/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So many people who don't play

4/3/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Think broader dude
4/3/18, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Prize money is consistently increasing
4/3/18, 8:51 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Do you still play?
4/3/18, 8:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Okay. Dying is a pop word for declining
4/3/18, 8:51 PM - Arpit Saxena: Lala does i think
4/3/18, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unfortunately
4/3/18, 8:52 PM - Kartik Vermun: Ye kahan se aaya

4/3/18, 8:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: So yeah to get anyone talking
4/3/18, 8:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I may have some career prospects in psychology
4/3/18, 8:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Just discuss his pain point
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: Makes me wonder
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: What are others pain points
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: ü§îü§î
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their ego
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: No let's say Rohan
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why me
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: OK anyone
4/3/18, 8:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nice experiment
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nice subject
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There are 7 people
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: Arpit se start Karo
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: Alphabetical
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Minus Satya minus u
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's good
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Arpit is too generic and boring
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No pain point
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: Hmm Arpit ka pain point
4/3/18, 9:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rohan would probably be egotistical about being behaved like a marginalized fool in a group
4/3/18, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A group who would consider him a moron
4/3/18, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And Ofcourse about his girlfriend
4/3/18, 9:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: As always Aniket trying to hijack the conversation
4/3/18, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üéÖüèø
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: For Arpit I would have said he is the loser of the twins
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kartik gets emotional about chutiypa
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Kartik Vermun: Really?
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If I hadn't know better
4/3/18, 9:02 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: When are you getting married dude? You have been dating her for like 6 years now. Wtf are you doing
4/3/18, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unfortunately Apoorv is so  dogshit that this pain point is impossible
4/3/18, 9:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Known
4/3/18, 9:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nazi, grammar nazi
4/3/18, 9:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In a year or two
4/3/18, 9:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I am not correcting myself, rather I am correcting the typo
4/3/18, 9:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't understand this
4/3/18, 9:05 PM - Kartik Vermun: Me neither
4/3/18, 9:05 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Nice!
4/3/18, 9:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I've seen you losing shit when people do chutiypa with you
4/3/18, 9:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gussa ho jaata hai
4/3/18, 9:06 PM - Kartik Vermun: Says the guy
4/3/18, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example if someone ignores you
4/3/18, 9:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah Kartik hates any sort of bs
4/3/18, 9:07 PM - Kartik Vermun: Who lost his shit many many times in aom
4/3/18, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yup
4/3/18, 9:07 PM - Kartik Vermun: Hmm never thought about it
4/3/18, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: Actually true now when I think about it
4/3/18, 9:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You are emotional
4/3/18, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Vivek se kaam lena nahi aata
4/4/18, 9:20 AM - Satya: https://youtu.be/7y4T7DnSeo0
4/4/18, 12:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aniket you didn't comment on competitive scene
4/4/18, 12:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not seen the video yet
4/4/18, 12:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Will see
4/4/18, 12:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What video
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking about DotA figures
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: DotA isn't just a video game
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I thought it was done
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You're right
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It has competitive scene
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm just saying that it has saturated much before
4/4/18, 1:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Player number had
4/4/18, 1:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Has
4/4/18, 1:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But what about viewers
4/4/18, 1:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dota is very dynamic man
4/4/18, 1:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You need to keep in touch to know about the map
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you fall out of touch then you face problems in viewing the game
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Unlike foot ball or cricket
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's good theory
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Have you checked what's viewership trend
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Is it increasing or decreasing
4/4/18, 1:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I've not
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's very difficult to check that anyhow
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you mad
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Just go to twitch
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They show stats
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Twitch is just one platform
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So what
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And people can watch it in groups like a TV show
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You always have error
4/4/18, 1:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow
4/4/18, 1:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: My point being that number of players is a good measure of popularity due to this reason
4/4/18, 1:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You saying advertising agencies have little idea
4/4/18, 1:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A person who doesn't play for long won't watch the game after years
4/4/18, 1:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why are you making theories you don't know
4/4/18, 1:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm making theories just that it isn't backed by viewing data
4/4/18, 1:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's just backed by player's data
4/4/18, 1:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And I'm just commenting on the nature of game. Am I wrong to in judging the nature of the game?
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I am saying you can get data on viewership reliably
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Pretty much
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I just pointed out the errors
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And you can't rely on twitch alone
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why not
4/4/18, 1:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow the point is bigger
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's the primary stream platform
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Twitch isn't the only platform
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: YouTube etc are also there
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's not the point man
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So get data on that also
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'll
4/4/18, 1:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok
4/4/18, 1:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The point being that my hypothesis is that players data is pretty much a reliable indicator to judge the popularity of the game
4/4/18, 1:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because of the nature of the game
4/4/18, 1:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't agree
4/4/18, 1:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you disagree then tell me a few good points
4/4/18, 1:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Your point is it is difficult to keep up with game unless you play it
4/4/18, 1:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I also say that there had to be a define lag between playing and viewing
4/4/18, 1:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well it is difficult to keep up but that makes you want to watch games
4/4/18, 1:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: At least in my case
4/4/18, 1:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In data to show the correlation
4/4/18, 1:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: If you browse DotA reddit a lot of redditors have stopped playing dota
4/4/18, 1:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But none of them have stopped watching pro scene
4/4/18, 1:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Small sample space
4/4/18, 1:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And a biased scene
4/4/18, 1:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I bet Arpit watches pro scene
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Reddit is not a good sample
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I imagine it's pretty similar everywhere else
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why would you say this?
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Reddit people are nerds most of the time
4/4/18, 1:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dota isn't all nerds
4/4/18, 1:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Also. Dota has saturated much before
4/4/18, 1:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 10 million active players only
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Players is just one thing
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You are undermining viewership
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's the whole hypothesis man. I'm contending that players data is a very good indicator of the heath of the whole game
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It isn't cricket or football
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rules change every couple of months
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why not
4/4/18, 1:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It has gone competitive
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: New heroes come in
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So what?
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Maps change
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Mechanics change it
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: SO WHAT
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How does that deter players to watch
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A person who is out of touch for a few patches can't catch up with the game.
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Let's establish one thing
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Unlike cricket or football
4/4/18, 1:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Viewership in DotA is still increasing
4/4/18, 1:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm too lazy to get data on that. But I know that prize pools of most premium tournaments is increasing. This wouldn't be possible if viewership wasn't increasing
4/4/18, 1:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: By how much?
4/4/18, 1:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: % wise
4/4/18, 1:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Also the decline in the players data will show a lag function in viewers data
4/4/18, 1:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I guess 4 patches of a difference will make it difficult to catch up
4/4/18, 1:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence a lag of about 8 -12 months
4/4/18, 1:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Game update dynamic has changed
4/4/18, 1:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Isntead of major patches it is now weekly updates
4/4/18, 1:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You can guess dude
4/4/18, 1:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Team that wins TI wins more money that previous champions combined
4/4/18, 1:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's worse
4/4/18, 1:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's even more dynamic now
4/4/18, 1:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's mainly due to compendium right?
4/4/18, 1:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: True
4/4/18, 1:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What's the base price that company is pitching in?
4/4/18, 1:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Compendium prize?
4/4/18, 1:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't know
4/4/18, 1:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
4/4/18, 1:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The base price for TI
4/4/18, 1:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Excluding the compendium sale
4/4/18, 1:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Also I think that company won't purposefully lower the base price
4/4/18, 1:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It sends a wrong signal to the community which can lead to a higher potential loss
4/4/18, 1:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A couple of million isn't a big thing for valve
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: DotA is definitely saturating
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But not dying
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Players decreasing
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dying is a pop word man
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Understand the sentiments behind it
4/4/18, 1:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: As arpit said. It's like cs
4/4/18, 1:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
4/4/18, 1:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
4/4/18, 1:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Saturation
4/4/18, 1:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Much in correlation with the players data
4/11/18, 10:06 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Syria war re escalating!
4/11/18, 1:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For sometime
4/11/18, 1:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's like the world War 2.
4/11/18, 1:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When all powers were trying to take as many parts of Germany as possible

4/23/18, 6:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Dude I don't even wanna be even close to the bizarro world of blondes.
4/23/18, 6:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's 24x7 bitching, idolizing Justin Timberlake, Justin beiber and Shawn mendes

5/12/18, 3:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Save literature!
5/12/18, 3:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You know this has been going on since ages
5/12/18, 3:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think I know what point you are trying to make
5/12/18, 3:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There's a concept called 'great culture' and 'lesser culture'
5/12/18, 3:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That this is how languages evolve
5/12/18, 3:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: These all are lesser culture
5/12/18, 3:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Never heard of this before
5/12/18, 3:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, for example these tribal dances, small town cuisines
5/12/18, 3:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are always present
5/12/18, 3:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Or hip hop ?
5/12/18, 3:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: üò¨
5/12/18, 3:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But they never become a part of the civilisation in a bigger way
5/12/18, 3:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They have a very low shelf life
5/12/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm afraid that's changing
5/12/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Would you say hip hop is more primitive
5/12/18, 3:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Actually, without technology hip hop is not possible
5/12/18, 3:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Culturally primitive
5/12/18, 3:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not technology
5/12/18, 3:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, majority of it
5/12/18, 3:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hip Hop is the most consumed music in the world
5/12/18, 3:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
5/12/18, 3:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can always say that hero sells the most bikes in India
5/12/18, 3:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't mean that they are better than Harley or royal enfield
5/12/18, 3:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's just point regarding this
5/12/18, 3:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A
5/12/18, 3:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I can tell you why
5/12/18, 3:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why?
5/12/18, 3:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Before technologies patrons of the arts were rich people
5/12/18, 3:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not with massive consumerism and availability to all
5/12/18, 3:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes,
5/12/18, 3:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is due to interconnectivity
5/12/18, 3:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *now
5/12/18, 3:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Inter regional availability of art
5/12/18, 5:57 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: There's always the intellectual elite or pretenders to that group that will keep that sort of literature/art alive.
5/12/18, 6:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw any good books you guys have read recently? Need something to kill time
5/12/18, 6:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The party

5/12/18, 6:05 PM - Kartik Vermun: Ol
5/12/18, 6:05 PM - Kartik Vermun: Ok
5/12/18, 6:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: One can read meditations by Marcus Aurelius
5/12/18, 6:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's better
5/12/18, 6:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Instead of 12 rules
5/12/18, 6:06 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay I'll start with the Party then.

5/12/18, 6:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok. Wohi I was wondering
5/12/18, 6:11 PM - Arpit Saxena: I've become sick of these video recommendations in my utube

5/12/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I faced that
5/12/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I had to remove the history
5/12/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And start as a clean slate
5/12/18, 6:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: Lol
5/12/18, 6:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yaar Wo Banda pop philosophy sikhata hai. And pop philosophy is an oxymoron
5/12/18, 6:13 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm
5/12/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wo shayad scientific method bhi follow nahi karta hai
5/12/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: To disprove a theory his go to argument is "we don't have enough proof". 

Aree bhai you bring one contradictory example to disprove. Not enough proof is never a good argument
5/12/18, 6:14 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Dude watch videos learning how to talk to girls in bars. That's what I'm learning these days
5/12/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: How are you rolling your Rs?

5/12/18, 6:15 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: What does that mean?
5/12/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Now the era is of fifty shades. It's very direct
5/12/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Your American accent.
5/12/18, 6:16 PM - Arpit Saxena: Lol
5/12/18, 6:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's not bad actually

5/12/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I got that it was misleading
5/12/18, 6:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I wish it was. It's so humbling to be rejected 9/10. Lol
5/12/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's because you're poor and Indian
5/12/18, 6:17 PM - Kartik Vermun: True that
5/12/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rich Asians bed a lot of white girls there

5/12/18, 6:18 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lol not true at all. Chinese are rich as fuck and they bed shit
5/12/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because they aren't able to speak
5/12/18, 6:18 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No, I don't want to make excuses. I have to get the physical appearance and charisma to that level of confidence
5/12/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: California me second generation Asians bed a lot of women
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Kartik Vermun: What's your source?
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter much
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just go in a group of your chela chapati
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Like a Don with his henchmen
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dress decently and tell me if you don't get girls
5/12/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's mainly because you're poor. Accept it
5/12/18, 6:20 PM - Kartik Vermun: Put an earpiece on
5/12/18, 6:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rest everything is fine
5/12/18, 6:20 PM - Kartik Vermun: And Aniket will tell you what to say
5/12/18, 6:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I get a lot of friends but that's about it. Plus wardrobe = $$$ so you're right about that
5/12/18, 6:20 PM - Kartik Vermun: Follow him word for word
5/12/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's true be. America is the heaven of individualism
5/12/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Whan par you need to sell yourself
5/12/18, 6:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That is very true. No one gives a fuck about anyone else
5/12/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's literally a social contract based society
5/12/18, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You give me something. I'll give you something
5/12/18, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And at the end most of the things boil down to money in America
5/12/18, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Show off. I mean
5/12/18, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's why people buy Rolex and expensive apparels
5/12/18, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It becomes easier to sell oneself
5/12/18, 6:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Money and appearance help a lot but in the end learning to sell yourself with confidence is the most important I feel
5/12/18, 6:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wo hai be
5/12/18, 6:24 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yup
5/12/18, 6:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kitna chaiye tujhe
5/12/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You know this selling up and selling down theory right?
5/12/18, 6:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No!
5/12/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example. The one who initiates the conversation is automatically on a lower pedestal in a conversation especially with girls
5/12/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Especially for sexual matters
5/12/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence never initiate the conversation as you will lose the weight in the conversation
5/12/18, 6:26 PM - Kartik Vermun: How do you score if you don't initiate?
5/12/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And the most depressing thing in a man is his lower ego or self worth
5/12/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's what I told
5/12/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You need to sell yourself that the girl initiates. And you have an upper hand
5/12/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Girls like being intimidated
5/12/18, 6:28 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lol I have a lot of really hot friends but the only time they ever initiate a conversation is when they have a question about architecture which is the the death knell of anything sexual to verify happening
5/12/18, 6:28 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: "ever
5/12/18, 6:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Example can be 

Don't start a conversation. Just do some random questioning. "Can you tell me the time? My phone just died "
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "What's that fragrance that you're wearing?"
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just one question and move away
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No other question
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Kartik Vermun: Cheesy
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Then sit somewhere you can be noticed
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah they will be like: okay here's a creepy guy
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And obererve if she is seeing you
5/12/18, 6:29 PM - Kartik Vermun: Lol
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Kartik Vermun: üòÇ
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: How? How's it creepy?
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You asked the time
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Or some very general question
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Non sexual
5/12/18, 6:30 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But those conversations lead nowhere
5/12/18, 6:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: And the girls will keep the conversation non sexual unless they are interested in you which never happens lol
5/12/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If she observes you then you can go the next time and initiate some good conversation
5/12/18, 6:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's usually means talking about Ke$ha and her prom dates
5/12/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's where expensive apparels help
5/12/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is the bar trick
5/12/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bars wagera me normal non intellectual crowd hone ki probability jayada hai
5/12/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They mainly care about money from then
5/12/18, 6:33 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah I feel I need to up my dressing game and get better at  saying right things at the right time
5/12/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rolex
5/12/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Movado
5/12/18, 6:34 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know the girls response to that: oh wow! That's pretty much what that I've seen a Rolex get people
5/12/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's the whole point
5/12/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's about getting initial attention
5/12/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wohi to important hai
5/12/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Uske baad obviously you need to know how to talk
5/12/18, 6:36 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I get that a lot already in studio with just my drawings and stuff. But it never goes anywhere from there beyong friendship
5/12/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
5/12/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But you can try bodybuilding and all
5/12/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me if you got laid with that
5/12/18, 6:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Many good men with better bodies are available + longer dicks
5/12/18, 6:38 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Let's see. My friend  tells me she thinks that being funny and confident is all that counts. If I crack the code I'll let you know lol
5/12/18, 6:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
5/12/18, 6:39 PM - Kartik Vermun: You guys can write 12 rules to get laid someday
5/12/18, 6:39 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Maybe if I improve from my current hit rate of 1/50
5/12/18, 6:40 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I bet someone like Rohan would be so much better at this sort of thing
5/12/18, 6:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ambi admired Rohan. Wow üò±üò±üò±üò±

That's where I think you are good. I'm actually giving you fair credit lol
5/12/18, 8:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Another back to back tareef
5/12/18, 8:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Rohan feels embarrassed
5/12/18, 8:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Was it your plan all along? :P
5/12/18, 9:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No I've just been salty after being friendzoned by one of the hottest girls I've known
5/12/18, 9:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Who she

5/12/18, 9:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ouch
5/12/18, 9:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: On the other hand I'm sure you have already imagined having babies with her
5/12/18, 9:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Well at the very least I saw a lot of movies with her. So that's something

5/21/18, 9:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't make sense though
5/23/18, 5:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: here is some right wing bhakt propoganda

5/23/18, 7:01 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Wtf this is the American version of the kunadli and horoscope logic that aunties believe in
5/23/18, 7:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
5/23/18, 7:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Horoscope at least tells the position of stars and planets correctly
5/23/18, 7:03 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I didn't know that!
5/23/18, 7:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: video seems fine
5/23/18, 7:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: you guys need to calm down holyshit
5/23/18, 7:13 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I find the liberal propoganda more nauseating though especially the feminist ones
5/27/18, 9:58 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: What do you guys think of Shashi Tharoor? Does he have real credentials or just the typical Congress verbose pseudo- intellectual that has done no real work with the beauracracy?
5/27/18, 11:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: He seems fine but does a lot of tu tu me me against political opponents
5/27/18, 11:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But I guess that's not his fault cuz maybe tu tu me me with political opponents is necessary to get mileage in India, or rather everywhere
5/27/18, 12:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Example of good political leader for me is like Nitin gadkari
5/27/18, 12:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Does no tu tu me me on social media and talk mostly about work
5/27/18, 12:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Talks
5/27/18, 12:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Plus his performance as transport minister is exemplary
5/27/18, 2:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He is chetta-nova
5/27/18, 2:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Laying beautiful girls left right and centre
5/27/18, 2:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: chetta= friend in malayalam
5/27/18, 10:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see. I like the central leadership. They all seem pretty competent. Wish they could get better leaders at the state level though
5/27/18, 10:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kiski?
5/27/18, 10:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: BjP
5/27/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kya be. Central leadership kahan hai?
5/27/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Random log hain
5/27/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Smriti irani changes ministries every year
5/27/18, 10:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Finance ministry kya kar rahi hai? Home ministry kya kar rahi hai?
5/27/18, 10:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Babus are running the government
5/27/18, 10:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Sushma swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad, nitin gadkari apart from modi and shah. Jaitley sucks
The rest  ones seem competent
5/27/18, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Defence minister nahi tha for one year cumulative
5/27/18, 10:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rohan might know more about defence but it's not doing very well.
5/27/18, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This make in india for defence is a nightmare
5/27/18, 10:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Assault rifles import karna padti hai. Bullet proof vests imported
5/27/18, 10:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Wasn't parrikar a good home minister?
5/27/18, 10:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Sorry defense
5/27/18, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The Rafael deal was good
5/27/18, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But house keeping Sahi nahi hai. Especially defence equipment acquisition
5/27/18, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Low tech products import karte hain hain
5/27/18, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bullets
5/27/18, 10:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Helmets
5/27/18, 10:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anti fire clothing
5/27/18, 10:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But tharoor is nice
5/27/18, 10:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Why though? Not enough know how or lack of funding?
5/27/18, 10:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: His whole experience is with the  UN. Can't seem fit into anything other than external affairs
5/27/18, 10:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nobody invests if the demand is risky. Why would some capitalist invest in bullet proof vest factory if the demand is very uncertain. 

And he can't even export and has no other buyer
5/27/18, 10:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe he's doing it at 60 what you can't at the age of 26
5/27/18, 10:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
5/27/18, 10:34 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Why not fund it with public money?
5/27/18, 10:34 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lol. Need to take cues from him
5/27/18, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because it's not efficient. Public owned factory are very inefficient in india. Ordinance factories today use pre 1960s equipments at times
5/27/18, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's the guru
5/27/18, 10:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
5/27/18, 10:35 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I visited the one in Jabalpur quite a few times. Quite a fortress
5/27/18, 10:36 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: First one was way hotter
5/27/18, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ofcourse
5/27/18, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But he gets it
5/27/18, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Look at his pot belly
5/27/18, 10:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Banda Sahi hai.
5/27/18, 10:37 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Lots of practice
5/27/18, 10:37 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's like DOTa. He is 6k at charming and being attractive to womeb
5/27/18, 10:39 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: And probably has humor much better than that üòõ
5/27/18, 10:39 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Though wouldn't vote for him for a public office
5/27/18, 10:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tharoor for pm
5/27/18, 10:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They should make him pm
5/27/18, 10:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Let RG be the new Sonia gandhi
5/27/18, 10:41 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: They should actually. Gandhi's probably have enough üí∞ to forever own the party anyways
5/27/18, 10:42 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Him vs Modi would be more interesting. It's too one sided atm
5/27/18, 10:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Don't discount congress
5/27/18, 10:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They have the largest vote share after BJP
5/27/18, 10:43 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's more likely BjP would lose than Congress winning anything
5/27/18, 10:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
5/27/18, 10:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Congress has been there many times
5/27/18, 10:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They always come back
5/27/18, 10:45 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I doubt they would this time though. Nobody treats rg as remotely credible. Maybe they'll win a few more and stitch up with others. Feeling it will end up a bit like Karnataka
5/27/18, 10:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: This time I am hoping to go through the CV of major candidates üòõ
5/27/18, 10:58 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: She is an astrologer and kundali expert. Wow
5/27/18, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
5/27/18, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: How does it matter
5/27/18, 10:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
5/27/18, 11:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No was just wondering what conversation topics/strategies Tharoor would employ for someone like her
5/28/18, 12:24 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And you think he is banging her
5/28/18, 12:34 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The angle is amazing
5/28/18, 12:37 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Defence is an administrative nightmare
5/28/18, 12:38 AM - Rohan Bhamre: 60 years of bureaucractic decadance.
5/28/18, 12:39 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Good luck repairing that with a system were the government is more concerned with political survival
5/28/18, 12:39 AM - Rohan Bhamre: You are expecting too much from muudi
5/28/18, 12:40 AM - Rohan Bhamre: He will need another term for that maybe
5/28/18, 1:27 AM - Aniket Awasthi: No. But he can if he wants
5/28/18, 1:27 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Research level 9000
5/28/18, 1:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I just did a reverse image search..
5/28/18, 1:29 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But you did
5/28/18, 1:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Politics and beauracracy is so complicated. People don't vote with rational logic but often just with emotions and word of mouth
5/28/18, 1:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Aren't you a democrat ?
5/28/18, 1:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm talking of administration and management really
5/28/18, 1:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: So many civil works offices still use files for records
5/28/18, 1:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: FILES DUDE!
5/28/18, 1:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I'm more in favor of oligarchy. Democracy is too random and just gives power in the hands of incompetent and dumb people
5/28/18, 1:32 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The fundamental flow lies the fact that voting is a right
5/28/18, 1:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: When it is clearly a skill
5/28/18, 1:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: How can a skill be a right
5/28/18, 1:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It should be a privilege
5/28/18, 1:33 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So you're not a democrat ?
5/28/18, 1:34 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Driving licence cannot be a right
5/28/18, 1:34 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Cause people still don't know how to use computers?
I wish a lot of Babu jobs were privatised. If you don't learn new ways to do things, you hey fired
5/28/18, 1:34 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Flaw
5/28/18, 1:35 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I'll vote Donald Trump
5/28/18, 1:35 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And Anuja hates me for that
5/28/18, 1:35 AM - Rohan Bhamre: She literally loses her shit when I say anything pro trump
5/28/18, 1:35 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: No I think it's a very dated system and needs to replaced with something more efficient
5/28/18, 1:36 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: You know I had more girls than guys in my class(around 25). I got to know nearly 14 of them voted trump
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Aniket Awasthi: lol
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Wow that sounds unbelievable
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Nahi
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It is true
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Rohan Bhamre: College campus is a conservative nightmare from what I see on the net
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Rohan Bhamre: In the usa
5/28/18, 1:37 AM - Aniket Awasthi: What ever california does in america; Indian upper middle class will do it 10 times more
5/28/18, 1:38 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's as simple as "my dad thinks this. My grandma thinks this". Pennsylvania is a pretty conservative place
5/28/18, 1:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: California is a whole different animal. They think they are a different country to the US

5/28/18, 1:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Obama was a nightmare for India
5/28/18, 1:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Hillary would have been bad for India too
5/28/18, 1:43 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Exactly! I don't get why people get so morally/ethically attached to something so distant.
5/28/18, 1:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I am telling you, you believe it or not
5/28/18, 1:44 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: What's so special about California though?

5/29/18, 10:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I would say
5/29/18, 10:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Btw what was the cost of moon landing
5/29/18, 10:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I guess it was about 25-30 billion dollars
5/29/18, 10:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I mean 1970 prices
5/29/18, 10:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dude maybe it's not always about the money
5/29/18, 10:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: $1.00 in 1970 had the same buying power as $6.54 in 2018
5/29/18, 10:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is; he's an entrepreneur who is taking money from investors

5/29/18, 10:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But that turned out very well; Nice logic
5/29/18, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And not delivering
5/29/18, 10:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is very naive to say waise,
5/29/18, 10:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The point is why are they investing in him
5/29/18, 10:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I think it is their sunk cost now
5/29/18, 10:13 PM - Kartik Vermun: Not saying investors can't be conned, theranos did it brilliantly
5/29/18, 10:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gale ki haddi, na ugli jaye na nigli jaaye

5/29/18, 10:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No thing is a bad investment
5/29/18, 10:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is always about price
5/29/18, 10:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There are better investments
5/29/18, 10:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, I mean if you can buy him at a low price then he'll be a good investment
5/29/18, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abhi he is over priced
5/29/18, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If tesla would have delivered the same using a few billions then it would have been a good investment
5/29/18, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Take an example of DRDO,
5/29/18, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They also deliver stuff
5/29/18, 10:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But you don't call them awesome

5/29/18, 10:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Delivering stuff is reliable
5/29/18, 10:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But awesome is being flashy
5/29/18, 10:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lul

5/29/18, 10:20 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yeah
5/29/18, 10:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Mai elon musk ko bura nahi keh raha hun; But I am just calling out blind fanboyism
5/29/18, 10:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just as people call Rohan Bhakt
5/29/18, 10:20 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: But doesent being charismatic and flashy gets you more business than being reliable.
5/29/18, 10:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Don't be a fanboy
5/29/18, 10:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan yaar, wohi to problem hai aaj kal ke investors ki

5/29/18, 10:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ü§£
5/29/18, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is as good as saying, you can't blame trump for winning using demagogy
5/29/18, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If you are good with Elon
5/29/18, 10:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: selling himself then you should be good with trump selling himself too
5/29/18, 10:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't. I believe in win by any means necessary ideology
5/29/18, 10:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ü§£
5/29/18, 10:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: In business and professional life I.e
5/29/18, 10:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ways justify the mean?
5/29/18, 10:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: end justify the means*
5/29/18, 10:24 PM - Kartik Vermun: Each to his own
5/29/18, 10:24 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes in business they do I think
5/29/18, 10:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe Ambi iska bohot bada critique hai
5/29/18, 10:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Kabhi baad me discuss karenge
5/29/18, 10:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think this ends justifies means and ways justifying means are misnomers
5/29/18, 10:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's more complicated than that
5/29/18, 10:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: @918101459296 tujhe bhi pata hoga; bata dena
5/29/18, 10:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Baad me discuss karte hai?
5/29/18, 10:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Virtue ethics vs categorical imperative vs goal based ethics
5/29/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan
5/29/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Exactly
5/29/18, 10:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tujhe pata hi hai
5/29/18, 10:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Then you're making a conscious choice of believing in "ends justify the means"
5/29/18, 10:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. It's better to be successful than virtuous üòõ
5/29/18, 10:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ab tu anti immigration sentiment Ko prejudice bolega kya
5/29/18, 10:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anti immigration sentiment is people being too lazy to compete
5/29/18, 10:29 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It is prejudice
5/29/18, 10:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Is it just economical?
5/29/18, 10:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think it's more social
5/29/18, 10:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I maybe wrong
5/29/18, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But surely it's more that just "foreigners stealing our jobs"
5/29/18, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Anti immigration sentiment trump used was against Mexicans and muslims
5/29/18, 10:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wo kaha itna job karte h
5/29/18, 10:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ita Asians and Indians who have jobs
5/29/18, 10:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No I see it here all the time. American s just want to work 9 to 5. They don't want to have to compete unless they have to which is understandable
5/29/18, 10:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: By Asians I mean chinkis
5/29/18, 10:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: They take a lot of these Walmart, subway jobs at absolute minimum wages

5/30/18, 3:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The op said that he wasn't being classist, but just Sharing and appreciating chachas taste
5/30/18, 3:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I think invoking chachas vocab on his anniversary is irrelevant
5/30/18, 3:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kinda does sound classist

6/17/18, 11:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I didnt know cobs music was structurally so similar to finish folk music
6/17/18, 11:29 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This sounds nice
6/17/18, 11:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Where does the cob music belong to?
6/17/18, 11:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's melodic death metal: heavy guitars and metal chorus-verse structure, melodic harmonic scale guitar leads and synth + laiho singing crappy stiff about death
6/17/18, 12:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They are a finnish band
6/17/18, 12:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Their melodies have always been amazing
6/17/18, 12:07 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Have you listened to afterlife by avenged sevenfold? That solo is out of this world

7/6/18, 9:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: Can anyone recommend good comedy specials on Netflix?
7/6/18, 9:57 PM - Kartik Vermun: Prime has some good ones also
7/6/18, 9:58 PM - Arpit Saxena: Kaunse? Specifically?
7/6/18, 9:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Zakir khan
7/6/18, 9:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Biswa
7/6/18, 9:58 PM - Kartik Vermun: Kanan gill
7/6/18, 9:58 PM - Arpit Saxena: Ok
7/6/18, 10:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's a very different presentation of comedy. Plus the conservatives here are going to have a riot with her 'lesbian' content.
7/7/18, 9:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Guys have you read Sapiens by Harrari?
7/7/18, 9:50 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: My mind was blown after reading it. Definitely the best book I've read in like 10 years
7/7/18, 10:02 AM - Satya: Yepp
7/7/18, 10:02 AM - Satya: Best? ü§î
7/7/18, 10:03 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Explained so many things so lucidly
7/7/18, 10:03 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And supported my no nation no conflict global world theory üòõ
7/7/18, 10:04 AM - Satya: Han, 1st was really good, 2nd half was kind of predictable
7/7/18, 10:04 AM - Satya: And boring
7/7/18, 10:04 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: True
7/7/18, 10:05 AM - Satya: Unless aliens attack us, not going to happen
7/7/18, 10:07 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I also just read it just after Sean Carol's arrow of time book. Interesting parallels with that.

I think it's a matter of time. Each imaginary construct has been replaced by a more bigger cooperative one. Religion to nation states to corporations now
7/7/18, 10:08 AM - Satya: Everytime he had a reason to unite
7/7/18, 10:08 AM - Satya: Not this time
7/7/18, 10:09 AM - Satya: Withiut externally conflict, there is not much incentive
7/7/18, 10:10 AM - Satya: Arrow of time. How is it?
7/7/18, 10:11 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: There always will be external stimuli. Logic based imaginary constructs replacing dna induced conflicts has been the trend. That's what I got from the book
7/7/18, 10:11 AM - Satya: What's the focus, science behind it or just history
7/7/18, 10:11 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's really good. Got me really into general relativity and learning the math
7/7/18, 10:11 AM - Satya: Haha
7/7/18, 10:12 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's a bit part of every major theory in physics right now : relativity, quantum field, string, standard model etc to explain why we.live in such a peculiar entropy condition
7/7/18, 10:12 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Very interesting
7/7/18, 10:13 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Worth a read
7/7/18, 10:18 AM - Satya: I'm following it right now
7/7/18, 10:19 AM - Satya: All speculations, no clear theory :P
7/7/18, 10:19 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Do you watch Fermi lab on YouTube?
7/7/18, 10:20 AM - Satya: I have seen some, not following the channel
7/7/18, 10:20 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah but educated speculations. Not Arnab goswami level ones üòõ
7/7/18, 10:21 AM - Satya: üòù
7/7/18, 10:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I live with two PhD physicists so that helps.
7/7/18, 10:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: üòõ

7/8/18, 12:45 PM - Arpit Saxena: Guys apoorv has been asking me everyday to add me to this group. He reads all the messages anyway. Should we have a vote to add him
7/8/18, 12:46 PM - Arpit Saxena: I liked Bill Burr. Also Kevin James and Ricky Gervais are good
7/8/18, 12:46 PM - Arpit Saxena: Btw so many lynchings in Dhule @919422709999
7/8/18, 12:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It happined in a tribal village
7/8/18, 12:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: Roz aa raha hai
7/8/18, 12:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are saying there's lynching everyday or the news runs everday
7/8/18, 12:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You*
7/8/18, 12:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: I assume both
7/8/18, 12:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: Warna kyun aata
7/8/18, 12:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: As far I know only one incident happened
7/8/18, 12:49 PM - Arpit Saxena: I saw 20 lynchings today
7/8/18, 12:49 PM - Arpit Saxena: But maybe that happened then only
7/8/18, 12:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to quote dr Ambedkar
7/8/18, 12:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The VILLAGE
7/8/18, 12:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unlike some mahatma's beliefs
7/8/18, 12:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Is a cesspool of ignorance and backwardness
7/8/18, 12:51 PM - Kartik Vermun: Bill burr is pretty cool
7/8/18, 12:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Its pulling India down
7/8/18, 12:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not indias strength
7/8/18, 12:51 PM - Arpit Saxena: Ambedkar said that? Wasnt he a dalit advocate
7/8/18, 12:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you saying all Dalits are villagers
7/8/18, 12:52 PM - Arpit Saxena: Dalit rights*
7/8/18, 12:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You castiest bitch
7/8/18, 12:52 PM - Arpit Saxena: ?
7/8/18, 12:52 PM - Arpit Saxena: At that time yes?
7/8/18, 12:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a child truth
7/8/18, 12:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *cold
7/8/18, 12:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: BR Ambedkar had urged Dalits to quit living in villages and move over to cities. He described that process of migration as ‚Äúnew life movement‚Äù for Dalits. Ambedkar‚Äôs famous quote on villages when he had reasoned, ‚ÄúThe love of the intellectual Indian for the village community is of course infinite, if not pathetic‚Ä¶What is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism‚Äù, is valid even today .
7/8/18, 12:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: Check out hasan Minaj's Netflix special
7/8/18, 12:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: Speaks about brown racism
7/8/18, 12:59 PM - Arpit Saxena: He seems annoying, racism shit
7/8/18, 12:59 PM - Kartik Vermun: Funny though man
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Arpit Saxena: But he overdoes it
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Arpit Saxena: MATLAB all his jokes are on that
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Arpit Saxena: Matlab*
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: I guess the theme of that special was racism
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm
7/8/18, 1:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: I haven't seen his other stuff
7/8/18, 1:01 PM - Arpit Saxena: He hosted some golden globes or something, usmein bhi
7/8/18, 1:01 PM - Arpit Saxena: Racism jokes
7/8/18, 1:01 PM - Kartik Vermun: Maybe awareness speared Kar raha Hai üòú
7/8/18, 1:02 PM - Arpit Saxena: I just want funny jokes
7/8/18, 1:02 PM - Kartik Vermun: Bill burr also has themes on various agendas
7/8/18, 1:03 PM - Kartik Vermun: Feminism specially

7/8/18, 1:04 PM - Kartik Vermun: Pregnant lady doing stand up
7/8/18, 1:04 PM - Arpit Saxena: Depends if it's funny or not
7/8/18, 1:05 PM - Arpit Saxena: Oh yeah dekha hai I think

7/8/18, 1:23 PM - Arpit Saxena: he just opens it...
7/8/18, 1:25 PM - You added Apoorv Umang
7/8/18, 1:25 PM - Arpit Saxena: Sup
7/8/18, 1:26 PM - Apoorv Umang: Sup*
7/8/18, 1:26 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yo be
7/8/18, 1:27 PM - Kartik Vermun: Kya tune bhi job chod diya?

7/8/18, 1:37 PM - Kartik Vermun: Peace
7/8/18, 6:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar is right. Villages are ignorant cesspools
7/8/18, 6:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But is urban society especially the elite society much different?
7/8/18, 6:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You must have heard about that Delhi golf club incident where they didn't allow a girl from NE India to come in as she was wearing her traditional dress
7/8/18, 6:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Elites are equally dogmatic in my opinion.
7/8/18, 6:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Surely not equally
7/8/18, 6:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Have you seen those people talking to lower class people?
7/8/18, 6:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Citing one case does not establish a trend.
7/8/18, 6:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Tell me where a group of women go out and have fun
7/8/18, 6:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In a city or a village
7/8/18, 6:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm not basing my argument on that be.
7/8/18, 6:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Can*
7/8/18, 6:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There are many religious festivals where village women meet
7/8/18, 6:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They have their own music and singing
7/8/18, 6:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They organize meals for each other too
7/8/18, 6:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Can you go out with your girlfriend in a village
7/8/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is very euro centric individualism
7/8/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You just shifted the goal post
7/8/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So be it
7/8/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We have westernised partly alrrady
7/8/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's immensely relevant still
7/8/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why is this bad
7/8/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You have a girlfriend I have a girlfriend
7/8/18, 6:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A society much always change and learn new things from other society. 

West is great and we must learn from it. However you shouldn't copy them blatantly
7/8/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's another matter
7/8/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You said it
7/8/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So I'm just replying
7/8/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The western society is not doing well as a society. Except for USA
7/8/18, 6:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think they are
7/8/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their TFR is about 1.5
7/8/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence their population is shrinking.
7/8/18, 6:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There are 1000 parameters to how a society is doing
7/8/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Secondly, more than 50%-60% births are out of wedlock in the west
7/8/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their family structure is collapsing
7/8/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: West was made on the three Fs. Father Family Fraternity
7/8/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Father boleto God
7/8/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even USA is doing good mainly because of their central region. Their families are still strong.
7/8/18, 6:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Again, there are 1000 parameters to that. And every parameter has even more angles to look at. The question is simple if you ask a person totally not related to Europe or India , which society you'd rather live in, you know what the answer would be
7/8/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Would you be willing to live in india or Uk in 1750?
7/8/18, 6:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are we living in 1750
7/8/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India had better living standards that time
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ..
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: A better society too
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is 2018
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We are getting sidelined
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe take this over a beer next time we meet
7/8/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/8/18, 6:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What do you think was a more prosperous period of India though
7/8/18, 6:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But you're not seeing the coming future
7/8/18, 6:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 1750 or Ashok or gupta
7/8/18, 6:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: On relative terms it was gupta 

Absolute terms it was 1750
7/8/18, 6:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Relative of coursr
7/8/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So?
7/8/18, 6:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Curious
7/8/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It was on a different note
7/8/18, 6:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
7/8/18, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You tell me this
7/8/18, 6:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not sure, India definitely had a higher GDP. But what about GDP per capita and all that. Do you have info on life comparison on the average indian vs the average UK
7/8/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Madison project calculated it
7/8/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They had comparable Gdp per capita at 1700
7/8/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In ppp terms obviously
7/8/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But still I'm giving you 1750 as a date as it was the starting of industrial revolution
7/8/18, 6:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm more interested in your point
7/8/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You answer me first
7/8/18, 6:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm really not sure aniket
7/8/18, 6:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's a choice
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You say per capita GDP was comparable
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What about war time then
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Aurangzeb was alive in 1700
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: War and peace
7/8/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: UK was going through many revolutions that time too
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Civil War
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Glorious revolution
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Then France ke saath bhi
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So was India
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sounds very comparable to me
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not clear cut
7/8/18, 6:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What else can we talk about
7/8/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe you have to choose
7/8/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I would choose to live in UK
7/8/18, 6:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why
7/8/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India had easier life that time though
7/8/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: UK was growing fast. It had many opportunities
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They were continously reforming the society too
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India was not
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Forgive me if I refrain from making an uneducated choice
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hmm ok I'd go with you too üò¨
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's essentially a choice between present vs future
7/8/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Like today I won't choose western society and it's path
7/8/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Eastern society like Japan is doing much better
7/8/18, 6:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Today it's clear cut dude
7/8/18, 6:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yup Japan's doing great
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: West was really doing great till 1980s
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Phir unko Pata nahi kya ho gaya
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But we are talking India's position in the world
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think it's still doing great
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India isn't good
7/8/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nahi.
7/8/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's doing good presently as people who are in working age are from 1970-2000
7/8/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just think what will happen when people who are born today will grow up
7/8/18, 6:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You are specifically talking about liberalism?
7/8/18, 6:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Radical leftism?
7/8/18, 6:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: USA needs too many immigrants to work for their technology and science. 

Their families are not able to provide for such a demand
7/8/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm talking about the western society in all. On facts and not on any particular ideology
7/8/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Matlab half of their PhD are immigrants
7/8/18, 6:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This isn't so for Japan
7/8/18, 6:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So a lot of these PhDs settle there only
7/8/18, 6:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What's wrong in this
7/8/18, 6:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Matlab domestic supply isn't doing good
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It wasn't so before
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye recent phenomenon hai
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Does it matter if PhDs come from outside and settle there
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Supply is met
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can't see the point be
7/8/18, 6:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Tell me
7/8/18, 6:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You can say it's not good for Anglo Saxon preotestonts
7/8/18, 6:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's about the society which can sustain itself.
7/8/18, 6:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Their model is failing
7/8/18, 6:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: As their societies are failing
7/8/18, 6:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm still not getting you dude
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you meaning this
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'm talking about the model on which the society is based on
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Is it bad if it's based on immigration
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: West has over done individualism
7/8/18, 6:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You're not seeing the issue
7/8/18, 6:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's about a balance between society vs individual
7/8/18, 6:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok
7/8/18, 6:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All such issues are also the dilemma between society vs individual
7/8/18, 6:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: West(exclud conservative USA) has become too individualistic
7/8/18, 6:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Which is failing their families
7/8/18, 6:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They can't compromise on their own needs for their family or their children
7/8/18, 6:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence this generation of children which are born there isn't very good
7/8/18, 6:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hasn't a certain ideology promoted this
7/8/18, 6:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter what ideology it is.
7/8/18, 6:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: These conditions the west is facing are certainly a thing they should worry about.
7/8/18, 6:45 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "Doesn't matter whether it is a black cat or a white cat if it catches the mice "
7/8/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But it still seems trivial to me. It's something they can fix
7/8/18, 6:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are trying since 3 decades now
7/8/18, 6:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They aren't able to fix it
7/8/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And they are still at the top
7/8/18, 6:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: People are just not having children
7/8/18, 6:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They provide huge tax benefits for families too
7/8/18, 6:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yet families are just breaking away
7/8/18, 6:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The growth of divorce is still positive
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Free education for children
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: These are such first world country problems , it's outrageous
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Child support etc
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But yet people aren't having children
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They have become too individualistic
7/8/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: How can you change this?
7/8/18, 6:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You when try to westenise yourself and try to learn from them you must be aware what not to learn from them
7/8/18, 6:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In India there is problem of curroption illiteracy education system basic hygiene healthcare poverty pollution women's safety infrastructure
7/8/18, 6:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They have been problems for 7 decades
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even after 200 years of trying to westenise
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think the west is better off
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Anyhow Indians suck
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No denying that
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't have any hopes from Indians
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: üòî
7/8/18, 6:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But if you are trying to copy the western individualism then it would be even worse
7/8/18, 6:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I wouldn't
7/8/18, 6:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because what you see today as the western civilization isn't made by people who presently live in it
7/8/18, 6:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was made by very society oriented people who tried not be very individualistic
7/8/18, 6:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They use to have 3-4 children for the family and the nation
7/8/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Haha
7/8/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Breed mothafuckas
7/8/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: For mother rashia
7/8/18, 6:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The three Fs. Father Family Fraternity
7/8/18, 6:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is their basis
7/8/18, 6:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's like the present lifestyle that you enjoy is not because of you but because of your father.
7/8/18, 6:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Similarly it's true for the west
7/8/18, 6:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But why do Indians suck
7/8/18, 6:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because they don't have a scientific mind
7/8/18, 6:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are dogmatic but not scientific
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a shame though. India has a great legacy
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even you at times just react with emotions than logic
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That India was made by people you absolutely hate today
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey tone down with the yous
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok.
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan be.
7/8/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dude it's like you don't even know me
7/8/18, 6:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe you take pride in shivaji
7/8/18, 6:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Right?
7/8/18, 6:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I do
7/8/18, 6:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was very religious, non individualistic and probably a conservative
7/8/18, 6:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In many terms
7/8/18, 6:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was a ardent student of his guru ramdas
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't hate religious people
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He did many things for the sake of the society
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You are religious aren't you
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He killed Portuguese because Portuguese slaughtered cows
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He detested them for conversions
7/8/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fuck you dude
7/8/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why would I hate anyone in that category
7/8/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have a very specific problem with religion.
7/8/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I celebrate all Hindu festivals
7/8/18, 7:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What is it?
7/8/18, 7:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I don't believe that Krishna was an avatar or Brahma created universe or that Ganesh was actually a person with the head of an elephant
7/8/18, 7:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I'd still celebrate Ganesh jayanti
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because I celebrate the moral values these festivals represent
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why do you think that every person is capable of high thinking or glory?
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not everyone can be a high thinker
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I dont
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So they need religion
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes we specifically spoke about this
7/8/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/8/18, 7:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In the modern era
7/8/18, 7:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The average human may not need these childish stories
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because if you have a society that believes Jesus was actually born to virgin Mary or that an illiterate warlord merchant said the word of allah
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe if you want to look how childish the society is, an instagram page of a wealthy south bombay girl will tell you
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Apoorv Umang: I'm so glad I joined this group today
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You create a society of stable but gullible people
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why
7/8/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
7/8/18, 7:06 PM - Apoorv Umang: Pure gold
7/8/18, 7:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All I'm saying is we have the means to be stable without religion today or in the future
7/8/18, 7:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Doesn't matter what color the cat is if it catches the mice
7/8/18, 7:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You've still not found any good substitute of religion
7/8/18, 7:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yet
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: First of all
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion isn't filling any void
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All experiments of eroding or loathing religion has resulted in a very fractured society
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There is no void
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So there's nothing to replace
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Did I send you one passage?
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: People previously were not capable of scientific reasoning.
7/8/18, 7:07 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Today they are

7/8/18, 7:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe wohi to issue hain. Science isn't doing the same thing as the religion does
7/8/18, 7:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You think this a game
7/8/18, 7:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Will science make you go at some strange festival where you don't know anything about who those people are?
7/8/18, 7:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have texted a year's worth today
7/8/18, 7:09 PM - Apoorv Umang: Spectator sport
7/8/18, 7:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye padhna
7/8/18, 7:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even ambi would support me here üòÇ
7/8/18, 7:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Where art thou @18144419636
7/8/18, 7:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I do that already
7/8/18, 7:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But a person who has grown without a religion. Will he also do it?
7/8/18, 7:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I am in a theatre with people o don't know
7/8/18, 7:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I go play badminton with people I don't knwo
7/8/18, 7:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Right now football crazies are doing crazy shit with people they don't know
7/8/18, 7:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You don't interact with people in theaters be!
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Can you relate with all badminton players?
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't interact with people in a temple either
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Football can't be a religion be!
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read this
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why don't you read this first?
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Uske baad we'll debate
7/8/18, 7:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Okok !
7/8/18, 7:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I will read this
7/8/18, 7:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But let me get this out.
7/8/18, 7:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In the past there was no communication social activities etc etc
7/8/18, 7:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Crowd control inst etc
7/8/18, 7:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Chtuye the log.
7/8/18, 7:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion aaya
7/8/18, 7:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Organised society
7/8/18, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Religion became so important
7/8/18, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hijacked society
7/8/18, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Every advancement in society got claimed by religion
7/8/18, 7:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have no problem with religion organising society
7/8/18, 7:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm saying we can have creed / community not based on childish stories and lies.
7/8/18, 7:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I mean I don't have problem with stories too
7/8/18, 7:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ramayan Mahabharat are great
7/8/18, 7:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Astronomical literarary and academic value.
7/8/18, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even the story itself is tasteful.
7/8/18, 7:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: BRB
7/8/18, 7:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Will reply to this in sometime
7/8/18, 7:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhai iv typed one years worth
7/8/18, 7:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Gn
7/8/18, 7:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gg*
7/8/18, 7:31 PM - Apoorv Umang: If you dont message in 5 mins you lose
7/8/18, 7:31 PM - Apoorv Umang: Last message was anikets so he's winning
7/8/18, 7:37 PM - Apoorv Umang: Gg lala lost wp boys
7/8/18, 8:22 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/8/18, 8:35 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Took me 15 mins to read through this üòÇ
7/8/18, 8:37 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Just would say one thing. The 'strong' white families of mid and mid west USA are just as parochial and racist as any backward Indian village
7/8/18, 8:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not about just racsim.
7/8/18, 8:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do you really think they overall as backward and dogmatic as the Indian village family
7/8/18, 8:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I understand indian villagers are not the only dogshit people around.
7/8/18, 8:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But their scale of dogshitness
7/8/18, 8:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In a strict comparison sense
7/8/18, 8:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Is definitely greater
7/8/18, 8:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Of course I don't know other dogshit people like I do indian villages
7/8/18, 8:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I can only guess
7/8/18, 8:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any stupid fucking shit paranormal activity happens in village
7/8/18, 8:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yup. Just replace working on a farm with McDonald's or some local mom and pop shop. Replace lynching with guns. Fanatic rituals with church. You will be surprised. It's just not reported as much in mainstream headlines
7/8/18, 8:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: These cucks start worshipping it
7/8/18, 8:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A boy falls ill local priest will say ABC blind faith procedure to cure his illness like pressing hot flat end of blade on the boy
7/8/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have seen drinking cow piss phenomenon but I've heard it happens in North Indian villages
7/8/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And don't even get me started on cleanliness
7/8/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Filth like there's no tomorrow
7/8/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't doubt that happens
7/8/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Question is how much lynching happens per 100000 people or something
7/8/18, 8:52 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think that's an equivalent metric. You should compare the lynchings per 10000 to gun related hate crimes per 10000 for a more fairer picture
7/8/18, 8:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes however a crime is statistically recorded
7/8/18, 8:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And compared
7/8/18, 8:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Indian villages are relatively less violent than that of mid west USA
7/8/18, 8:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: However USA is an abberation because of gun laws. Compare them with villages of Europe
7/8/18, 8:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Western Europe
7/8/18, 8:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: USA ke sirf 10% people reside in villages. Shouldn't compare
7/8/18, 8:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Compare the two similar size towns and not villages
7/8/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I wasn't talking of violence anyway
7/8/18, 9:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: A
7/8/18, 9:01 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Also I agree on religion. Science can never replace it. Nature and life events are too random for logic to surpass faith in God.
7/8/18, 9:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
7/8/18, 9:03 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hygiene and health standards is something I would agree on. West does far better
7/8/18, 9:04 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's undisputable that living standards in terms of facilities are better. It gets murkier and more grey when you start getting into 'quality' of life.
7/8/18, 9:16 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Btw, what do you think the 'superhuman' replacement of religion will be?
7/8/18, 9:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Asking me
7/8/18, 9:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
7/8/18, 9:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah
7/8/18, 9:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't know
7/8/18, 9:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: As far as I've seen the society. Religion has no replacement
7/8/18, 9:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: From China to Kazakh to Russia
7/8/18, 9:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All such experiments have failed
7/8/18, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There hasn't been any institution in society that was as powerful as religion
7/8/18, 9:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's unique
7/8/18, 9:19 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Nation states?
7/8/18, 9:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They always had state religion
7/8/18, 9:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nation states are very fragile. They come and go
7/8/18, 9:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Nation states had deep roots in religion
7/8/18, 9:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like ABC is a nation of xyz Christians
7/8/18, 9:21 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Fucking useless human DNA is too fragile too handle truth
7/8/18, 9:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The god truth?
7/8/18, 9:25 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: No religon exists because biologically we are afraid of random probablistic events and rules of nature hence seek comfort and peace of mind in the imaginary idea of something protecting us
7/9/18, 5:38 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Called Dhule?
7/9/18, 5:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I grew up in South Bombay. Lost all connections to the wealthy girls there :/
7/9/18, 5:50 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Welcome to the rant club :D
7/9/18, 5:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Get those back
7/9/18, 5:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòõ
7/9/18, 6:05 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Am presently 80kgs. Now is not the time :P
7/9/18, 6:05 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Sapiens?
7/9/18, 6:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/9/18, 6:08 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Money
7/9/18, 6:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Institution kahan hai wo
7/9/18, 8:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dhule is a district place. In it is Dhule city from where I come from. But God knows how many villages are there in dhule
7/9/18, 8:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This particular lynching incident happened in some Banjara tribal village I didn't even know existed
7/9/18, 8:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In the district, that is
7/9/18, 8:06 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Everyone is part of the institution of money
7/9/18, 10:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So abstract.
7/9/18, 11:19 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: If you'd consider the Church to be the institution of Catholicism, then banks might be considered the institution for money. But whereas the church caters to Christians only, money caters to all.
7/9/18, 11:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Can't disagree
7/10/18, 10:15 AM - Kartik Vermun: Money bigger than religion then
7/14/18, 3:09 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Guys hyper bypartisan animosity is destroying civic discourse. so much hate
7/14/18, 3:10 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's literally pure unadulterated hatred for the political opponents by dangerous proportion of people.
7/14/18, 3:10 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Seeing it in the whole world
7/14/18, 3:11 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I guess I should stop reading Twitter
7/14/18, 4:11 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or news for that matter
7/14/18, 8:01 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It's not a good place for discussion
7/14/18, 9:05 AM - Kartik Vermun: Majority of daily news is useless gossip and speculations
7/14/18, 9:08 AM - Kartik Vermun: People trying to create perceptions rather than delivering unbiased unopinionated content
7/14/18, 9:09 AM - Kartik Vermun: Btw did anyone see sacred games
7/14/18, 9:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Lack of censorship allowed anurag kashyap to take a dig at congress
7/14/18, 9:12 AM - Kartik Vermun: Among other things
7/14/18, 9:22 AM - Kartik Vermun: pretty awesome
7/14/18, 10:08 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe you know. 

There was one study by one anthropologist in USA that talked about blacks having disproportionately higher crime rate, abuse rate, disease rate and so on. 

That study was highly criticized on being "racist" and was shouted down
7/14/18, 10:09 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Such is a level of scientific discourse now in humanities. 

That guy from Google was removed for his "sexist" comment. He wasn't even given a fair chance to prove himself
7/14/18, 10:11 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Dude why are you formatting your text in WhatsApp
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Professional much
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Nahi to
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I mean paragraphs
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Rohan Bhamre: üò¨
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Ooh
7/14/18, 10:12 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's good
7/14/18, 10:13 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Yeah, you were saying
7/14/18, 10:14 AM - Aniket Awasthi: India me Phir bhi there are studies on castes, ethnicities etc which are not shouted down. 

Even though there are some no go areas like reservations, rural area romanticism which one can't really condemn. But he USA wagera me they are overdoing liberalism
7/14/18, 10:15 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I saw an explanation for that in Sapiens. Blacks have have been discriminated against for centuries so that stat makes sense according to that book.
7/14/18, 10:16 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Point Wo nahi hai. Point is that such studies are now called "racist".
7/14/18, 10:16 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: USA is a weird place. It is superficially very liberal and people are superficially very nice.
7/14/18, 10:16 AM - Kartik Vermun: It's build on a copp
7/14/18, 10:17 AM - Kartik Vermun: *corporate culture
7/14/18, 10:17 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's part of the superficial culture. prevailing now.
7/14/18, 10:17 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. But why's it in academia?
7/14/18, 10:18 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Wo Google wala case. What's your opinion on it?
7/14/18, 10:18 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. I think that's exactly it. This weird.liberalism allows such companies to function by people being superficially nice and tolerant. Academia sort of gives the intellectual basis for such a culture to develop
7/14/18, 10:19 AM - Kartik Vermun: Sundar pichai saving googles image
7/14/18, 10:19 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Google has a social image to keep. As.long it convinces women people it is liberal it's good for business.
7/14/18, 10:20 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Right
7/14/18, 10:20 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: And lots of women would believe that's what Google real ideology is I guess
7/14/18, 10:20 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's like using sex equality as a conodity
7/14/18, 10:21 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Sex equality is sacred now. Unquestionable.
7/14/18, 10:21 AM - Kartik Vermun: Business first always when talking about industry
7/14/18, 10:21 AM - Aniket Awasthi: True
7/14/18, 10:22 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I bet 50 years from now, the current 'liberal' society would be seen as very oppressive and unimaginable to live in.
7/14/18, 10:22 AM - Kartik Vermun: Superficially nice is still okay although a bit annoying at times
7/14/18, 10:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe just a digression. Kartik Twitter par faltu anti Elon musk ek group hai
7/14/18, 10:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They criticize him a lot. I found one criticism very funny. I'll share it
7/14/18, 10:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: He said it not me! üòÖ

Cave rescuer slams Elon Musk's submarine idea, says "He can stick his submarine where it hurts,wouldn't have made the first 50m, Just a PR stunt" -CNN $TSLA
(Repost for twitter video h/t @TezzlaCFO) https://t.co/GHWiILrPq5
7/14/18, 10:24 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I didn't even follow the Thai cave story
7/14/18, 10:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Funnily enough no one considers economic inequality as a similar concern to gender one which is the fad now in Western society. How is being poor and being denied opportunity any different from being a woman and being denied an opportunity?
7/14/18, 10:24 AM - Kartik Vermun: Some footballers and a coach trapped in a cave
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I am aware of the outcome
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: This incident reminds me of that indian kid falling in a well or something
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Because gender inequality affects middle class and upper class women
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Long back
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Overnight star he had become
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's another Western media fetish. The heroic rescue of poor Asians somewhere
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Haha
7/14/18, 10:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/14/18, 10:26 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Seriously
7/14/18, 10:26 AM - Kartik Vermun: ü§£üëç
7/14/18, 10:26 AM - Rohan Bhamre: This is the bigotry of low expectations
7/14/18, 10:27 AM - Aniket Awasthi: @917891947877 ek aur golden topic chal raha hai. You can lurk
7/14/18, 10:27 AM - Kartik Vermun: I'm sure he is along with @917407650530
7/14/18, 10:28 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/14/18, 10:28 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Not yet
7/14/18, 10:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Interesting evidence
7/14/18, 10:28 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Honestly companies have realised that adopting as non-controversial stance as possible is the best in an environment with polarized opinions.
7/14/18, 10:30 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Second that. Blacks have higher crime rates. Period. Beating about the bush on that will never help solve the problem.
7/14/18, 10:30 AM - Kartik Vermun: Survival and diplomacy
7/14/18, 10:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe if you look at history. The whole western civilization, it's growth and glory had a base on scientific method of research. 

Companies can do whatever they want but the science was protected especially from 18th century onwards
7/14/18, 10:30 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know but it's not just about a company stance. I can live without the fakest good morning with a beaming smile on.the street. It happened so much when I was in Grad school
7/14/18, 10:31 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That doesn't happen in India at all
7/14/18, 10:31 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a similar scenario with refugees in sweden
7/14/18, 10:31 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/14/18, 10:32 AM - Kartik Vermun: Fake smiles are okay, fake people without skills building fake products angers me
7/14/18, 10:32 AM - Aniket Awasthi: BTW just flagging that refugees in Sweden are alhumdulliah people. And rohan mentioned them
7/14/18, 10:32 AM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/14/18, 10:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Call them by their proper name you Islamophob
7/14/18, 10:33 AM - Rohan Bhamre: E
7/14/18, 10:33 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Middle Eastern humans
7/14/18, 10:34 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Oohhh fiery
7/14/18, 10:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/14/18, 10:34 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I can feel the fury
7/14/18, 10:35 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's what the hot girls do all the time. üòõ
7/14/18, 10:35 AM - Kartik Vermun: üòÇ
7/14/18, 10:37 AM - Kartik Vermun: I always cite theranos and Elizabeth Holmes as a golden example
7/14/18, 10:37 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/14/18, 10:38 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's a good one.!
7/14/18, 10:38 AM - Kartik Vermun: And Kickstarter pe people raise money for bullshit products
7/14/18, 10:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I always use this video as an example
7/14/18, 10:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=txBfhpm1jI0
7/14/18, 10:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: This girl made this when she was 16
7/14/18, 10:39 AM - Kartik Vermun: Seems like u don't need to build a genuine thing to get money, just grand promises
7/14/18, 10:43 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's what I learnt from Sapiens. You just need to convince people something is good. Objective benefits/qualities don't really matter or are secondary
7/14/18, 10:44 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Kitna bhi intellectually evoll e lat Jaye, dna is is still of a chimp üòõ
7/14/18, 10:44 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: *evolve
7/14/18, 10:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Abe ambi don't get too much moved by that book. It's pop anthropology.
7/14/18, 10:45 AM - Kartik Vermun: I'll read it sometime man
7/14/18, 10:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know. I can get that from the random and often ludicrous analogies he uses. But in between there are some really compelling poinys
7/14/18, 10:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I agree. Just don't be biased, that's what I was warning
7/14/18, 10:46 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Their veracity I can't judge without reading much more in though
7/14/18, 10:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Wo at the end of the day pop anthropology hi hai. Not a detailed book
7/14/18, 10:46 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes true
7/14/18, 10:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Like you would remember how people are moved by micro economics 1 and 2. Later on they realize the nuances
7/14/18, 10:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see but it at least gets people more interested to delve deeper.   I managed to learn about Dna sequences and biology after that
7/14/18, 10:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: As a follow-up
7/14/18, 10:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: But on that note higher PPP or GDP = higher quality of life is a myth and a very Western centric notion
7/14/18, 10:55 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They have many such indices now; green gdp, happiness index, HDI, SPI
7/14/18, 10:56 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm a simple man
7/14/18, 10:56 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Boobs=like
7/14/18, 10:57 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: That's like every girl I had in my class in school or see on the beach. I.dont even notice it now
7/14/18, 10:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: üòî
7/14/18, 10:58 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Somehow it's a requirement to be hot
7/14/18, 10:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I can definitely see why
7/14/18, 10:59 AM - Aniket Awasthi: What was the point of the video? that she was stripping off?
7/14/18, 10:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Video seemed fine
7/14/18, 10:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Not unlike Avril Lavigne Ambi listens to
7/14/18, 11:04 AM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
7/14/18, 11:06 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Nothing other than that normal people have to work 7 days a week to win stuff but girls can accomplish that with a big smile and some boobs and then cry about inequality
7/14/18, 11:07 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Haha
7/14/18, 11:09 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Emo music has always been my guilty pleasure.
7/14/18, 11:09 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I can't justify it logically. It's the DNA of a chimp acting up
7/14/18, 11:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a very parochial way of thinking. It is similar to compare your job with a whore and complaining that you earn less than her. 

It is also about the job profile and also about the size of the market. Like how many such girls are there who can be so popular with lower effort effort? Secondly, after 10-15 years of your job, you will be better positioned than most of such video girls.
7/14/18, 1:03 PM - Apoorv Umang: Nice. I'll join the discussion soon let me formulate my thoughts
7/14/18, 1:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Prelims cleared

7/14/18, 4:37 PM - Apoorv Umang: Congratulations!
7/14/18, 4:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Thanks

7/17/18, 1:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Good time to buy
7/17/18, 3:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why did he call him a pedo
7/17/18, 3:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because he's a British expat living in Thailand
7/17/18, 3:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Stereotype
7/17/18, 3:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Thailand me they settle for girls she males etc
7/17/18, 3:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How did he not expect backlash
7/17/18, 3:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I guess it's very easy to slip up in this page culture
7/17/18, 3:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Outrage*
7/17/18, 3:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://twitter.com/classiclib3ral/status/1018583452063600641?s=21
7/17/18, 3:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Look how his cult members are defending him
7/17/18, 3:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't doubt it
7/17/18, 3:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/17/18, 3:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "You don't become Elon by being normal. You become Elon by being extremely obsessive. "
7/17/18, 3:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You really must hate Elon musk
7/17/18, 3:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't
7/17/18, 3:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I just don't like blind following
7/17/18, 3:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Fan clubs
7/17/18, 3:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nobody is beyond the scope of criticism
7/17/18, 3:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Apoorv
7/17/18, 3:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: His fans and Modi fans or unreasonable liberals are the same.
7/17/18, 3:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We shouldn't let the fringe sideline us
7/17/18, 3:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even liberals know that you're not the fringe. They just overhype it to silence you
7/17/18, 3:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: The debate is never reasonable it mainly dialectic
7/17/18, 3:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do you know about that Sushma Swaraj controversy
7/17/18, 3:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/17/18, 3:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sadly liberals aren't fringe they are mainstream
7/17/18, 3:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So she recieved a lot of hateful comments on that
7/17/18, 3:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: She took a wrong decision.
7/17/18, 3:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Based on emotive response and not facts or procedures
7/17/18, 3:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are you sure?
7/17/18, 3:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/17/18, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There was address discrepancy. As they were married so they should usually have same address
7/17/18, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They also didn't have same last names
7/17/18, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That guy was just following the norms
7/17/18, 3:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So my point is
7/17/18, 3:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: After getting hateful comments she proceeded to like the most hateful ones
7/17/18, 3:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like and retweet
7/17/18, 3:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Then she tweeted that you should be civil and all
7/17/18, 3:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's fine
7/17/18, 3:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But there were even more people who respectfully asked about the fiasco
7/17/18, 3:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: To them she gave no reply
7/17/18, 3:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Classic example of getting sidelined by the fringe
7/17/18, 3:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/17/18, 3:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Issues always get hijacked like this
7/17/18, 3:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I guess you're not seeing the bigger picture
7/17/18, 3:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which picture
7/17/18, 3:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You think that Twitter is a place for reasonable discussion which is wrong. It's a place of rhetoric and not any discussion.
7/17/18, 3:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It is clearly not
7/17/18, 3:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Twitter kya. I don't see any discussion anywhere
7/17/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Liberals will always use the actions of "fringe" and associate it with you
7/17/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And the rw does the same with liberals
7/17/18, 3:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's why I absolutely despise late night shows
7/17/18, 3:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not about comedy at all is just a sick excuse to cheer your own rhetoric
7/17/18, 3:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There's a research on this
7/17/18, 3:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I read it and person actually made a nodal graph of how people discuss topics
7/17/18, 3:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/17/18, 3:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They just talk with each other and bitch about the other group
7/17/18, 3:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They never discuss it with the other group
7/17/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Are we doing the same?üò¨
7/17/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'd like to think we don't

7/17/18, 5:22 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Somewhat libertarian
7/17/18, 5:24 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: "While the bhadralok were influenced by the West (in terms of their morals, dress, and eating habits) they were also the people who reacted most strongly against the West, and the most scathing critiques as well as the most spirited defences of Westernisation were made by bhadralok writers."
7/17/18, 7:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Raja ram mohan Roy was a prominent one

7/20/18, 6:50 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Is welfare economics considered right wing?
7/20/18, 8:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: In modern times no economist can challenge welfare
7/20/18, 8:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But the only difference they have is about the degree of redistribution and secondly how to re distribute
7/20/18, 8:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Neo con people talk about direct benefits transfer or conditional cash transfer
7/20/18, 8:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Liberals like more state involvement in education health and so on
7/20/18, 8:52 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Education and health are not supposed to be as expensive as they are in US. Insurance players and health companies have learnt that the health insurance collusion makes much more money than a free markets. College education could easily be more expensive if public schools were out.
7/20/18, 8:53 AM - Aniket Awasthi: USA has failed in health
7/20/18, 8:55 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you know people there don't go to the doctor unless they get critical. 

Because by law if someone is admitted in emergency then they can't be liable for paying for emergency operations
7/20/18, 8:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: American spend twice as much as European on medical sector. Yet their health outcomes are worse than that of Europe Japan and south Korea 

Excluding research and development.
7/20/18, 9:02 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Actually American education is expensive because of their visa norms. 

Companies in USA can't directly hire people from developing world. It's very difficult as quota is less. So people have to get into universities just as a way to get work visa
7/20/18, 9:05 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Wto me GATS agreement Agar sign ho jayega to I guess most of the masters courses in universities will just dry up immediately
7/20/18, 9:12 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: That's news to me
7/20/18, 9:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: What is?
7/20/18, 9:59 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: GATs agreement
7/20/18, 9:59 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: If so you're quite right
7/20/18, 9:59 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Master's just for education's sake will not be quite as appeasing

7/21/18, 8:11 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: We should all be vigilant against a single story 
The danger of a single story
https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story
7/21/18, 10:06 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Gun control is essential if the state is weak and society is armed. Example states like in Europe need stringent gun laws. 

Homosexuality is a natrual phenomenon although it's not normal. Marriage seems to be fine however they shouldn't be allowed to adopt children as we don't have enough scientific evidence on psychology of children. 

Climate change üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
7/21/18, 10:07 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. This is called sensationalism
7/21/18, 10:08 AM - Aniket Awasthi: What are your views? @14043680303
7/21/18, 11:41 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Have we spoken about homosexuality, cause that's exactly what I think
7/21/18, 11:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/21/18, 11:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Although I slightly doubt that homosexuality is not healthy
7/21/18, 11:42 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Personal health
7/21/18, 11:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan, gaand marne ke liye nahi hoti hai
7/21/18, 11:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They have disproportionate share of HIV AIDS
7/21/18, 11:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: and other STI
7/21/18, 11:44 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And not just physical health. It must have some psychological ramifications cucumber obviously your social growth is drastically different
7/21/18, 11:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Also, homosexual marriage doesn't include Public Display of love and cockfests. Public decency must be maintained.
7/21/18, 11:45 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea how the cucumber came to be in the sentence
7/21/18, 11:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: ü§£
7/21/18, 11:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Don't call it cucumber; call it organic dildo
7/21/18, 11:46 AM - Rohan Bhamre: That's just some low life hipster shit
7/21/18, 11:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, confine it to the bedroom
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What about this though
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Does homosexuality have any adverse psychological effects?
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: There are no good and conclusive psychological studies on it yet
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So we can't say
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I doubt we can ever have an honest scientific study on it
7/21/18, 11:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: The major issue is the how would you design an experiment?
7/21/18, 11:48 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Given it it such a politicised issue
7/21/18, 11:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I think, it is also a problem of design of experiments
7/21/18, 11:49 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Matlab; first it is very difficult to create a control group. Secondly, it is difficult to design the indices that we want to measure
7/21/18, 11:49 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Psychological health matlab exactly kya ?
7/21/18, 11:50 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Gays have a fully functioning analytical brain.
7/21/18, 11:50 AM - Rohan Bhamre: We know that
7/21/18, 11:56 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm guessing sexual orientation changes your behaviour with the opposite sex. And social interactions with the opposite sex plays an important role in social and psychological development of a person.
7/21/18, 11:56 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Hmmm
7/21/18, 11:56 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But wohi hai fir baat ki what qualifies as psychological health
7/21/18, 11:57 AM - Rohan Bhamre: No idea
7/21/18, 11:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: You can create your own metric of measurement which others can deny
7/21/18, 11:57 AM - Kartik Vermun: A lot of homosexuals will object you calling it not normal
7/21/18, 11:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It will become very subjective
7/21/18, 11:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhai homosexuality chod
7/21/18, 11:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Talk transgender
7/21/18, 11:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: That's actually crazy shit
7/21/18, 11:58 AM - Kartik Vermun: Are they hijras?
7/21/18, 11:59 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/21/18, 11:59 AM - Kartik Vermun: Or male in a female body and vice versa
7/21/18, 11:59 AM - Kartik Vermun: Seems confusing at times
7/21/18, 11:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: People cutting off healthy body parts, injecting hormones while all their body cells still having the original sex chromosome
7/21/18, 12:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Still have*
7/21/18, 12:00 PM - Kartik Vermun: Torture man

7/21/18, 12:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: How in the world is this advocated as a healthy procedure
7/21/18, 12:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What do mean
7/21/18, 12:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I know the distinction
7/21/18, 12:02 PM - Kartik Vermun: Care to elaborate @919425052635
7/21/18, 12:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sarcasm
7/21/18, 12:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Okay
7/21/18, 12:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's the most unscientific bullshit
7/21/18, 12:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is now the modern narrative. Where sex and sexuality are mutually exclusive.

7/21/18, 12:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's cruel
7/21/18, 12:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Actually, I have a very compelling argument against homosexuality in public.

I as an individual have my personal right to liberty. This includes my right to reputation. If homosexuality with public display of love is normalised in the society. It would be very easy for someone to think of me as gay even if I am hanging out with any male friend of mine in public.

If someone thinks of me as gay I would feel it as an infringement of my right to reputation and liberty.
7/21/18, 12:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence, public display of love for homos must be outlawed.
7/21/18, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Can you say that someone thinking of you as gay is a defamation?
7/21/18, 12:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *defamation

7/22/18, 9:26 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Awesome I'll plan something soon. Haven't been to those parts at all yet
7/22/18, 9:26 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It might be a higher estimate.
7/22/18, 9:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I didn't follow that story.
7/22/18, 9:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Actually it's a government estimate. So it's a pessimistic estimate
7/22/18, 9:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rights-toilets/clean-india-mission-not-ending-manual-scavenging-activists-say-idUSKBN1CW1YF
7/22/18, 9:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You know these bhangi, mehtar, mahar, jatav, balmiki etc
7/22/18, 9:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: These are castes involved in this activity
7/22/18, 9:32 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Govt estimates peg it at .75 million though that seems low.
7/22/18, 9:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No
7/22/18, 9:32 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
7/22/18, 9:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Socio economic caste census of 2011 is the government data
7/22/18, 9:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is just underestimation by ias babus to meet their target
7/22/18, 9:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://scroll.in/article/841580/government-claims-to-have-assisted-91-of-indias-manual-scavengers-without-counting-93-of-them
7/22/18, 9:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Probably
7/22/18, 9:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But 3 million is a lot
7/22/18, 9:35 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I'm not saying it may not be true, but it's a lot
7/22/18, 9:36 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: UP, Kashmir and Bengal seem to be the worst offenders
7/22/18, 9:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/22/18, 9:37 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yep! Atlanta's got some decent spots :)
7/22/18, 9:38 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: World of Coke, and a huge aqaurium
7/22/18, 9:39 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: <Media omitted>

7/22/18, 9:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They are into yellow journalism
7/22/18, 9:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sensationalism
7/22/18, 9:42 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But that's what Jayant Sinha wanted. I'd never heard of him before and now he's on the radar. Same as Yogi, same as Varun Gandhi.
7/22/18, 9:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Tune Wo poora incident padha hai?
7/22/18, 9:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Looks amazing!
7/22/18, 9:46 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
7/22/18, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Where to even read about this
7/22/18, 9:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wire and opindia padh lo
7/22/18, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: All reports will be riddled with confirmation bias from both sides
7/22/18, 9:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://youtu.be/VAFRmkGiivA
7/22/18, 9:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's why read both
7/22/18, 9:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Centrist unbiased reporting is an oxymoron

7/23/18, 4:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Your Political Compass

Economic Left/Right: 2.63 
Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: 4.62
7/23/18, 4:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/23/18, 4:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I thought questions would be of political ambiguity
7/23/18, 4:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not straight up factual
7/23/18, 4:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is an old test
7/23/18, 4:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is eurocentric too
7/23/18, 4:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi ko liberterian left kaun bol sakta hai matlab
7/23/18, 4:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi was a conservative
7/23/18, 4:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hipsters who rant against capitalism while sipping their Starbucks who sell naked pics online
7/23/18, 5:14 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Compared to his times, he supported multiple minorities, religions coming together.
7/23/18, 5:14 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Libertarians are pro-capitalism
7/23/18, 5:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I didn't say libertarians
7/23/18, 5:16 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Erm, so well Gandhi's supporters are hippies
7/23/18, 5:16 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Or at least those you think he was left
7/23/18, 5:16 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: And you wonder why left and right don't find a dialogue
7/23/18, 5:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: When did I say Gandhi supporters are hipsters
7/23/18, 5:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In popular culture hipsters are people with annoying traits of over enthusiastic progressivism
7/23/18, 5:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: They are not "the" left
7/23/18, 5:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think the point where the left and right don't have a dialogue is when someone "straw man"s the other.
7/23/18, 5:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like this
7/23/18, 5:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And this
7/23/18, 5:21 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Libertarians are pro-capitalism by definition
7/23/18, 5:22 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: And this
7/23/18, 5:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not straw man ing if I am not misrepresenting you
7/23/18, 5:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Your argument
7/23/18, 5:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *
7/23/18, 5:23 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And again. I was not talking about libertarians
7/23/18, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It was really a light hearted comment about the hipsters people usually like to bitch about.
7/23/18, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
7/23/18, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kinda like this one
7/23/18, 5:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Please don't destroy me
7/23/18, 5:26 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: "Queen of Nuance" üòÇüòÇ
7/23/18, 5:26 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Should certainly ask her if Gandhi was left.
7/23/18, 5:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Lol
7/23/18, 5:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan is right
7/23/18, 5:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's like a republican having a inter faith lunch with yahoodis
7/23/18, 5:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It was mainly politics
7/23/18, 5:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: As in political right?
7/23/18, 5:35 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/07/liberal-gandhi/
7/23/18, 5:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Where are you on the compass
7/23/18, 5:38 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I think Khilafat movement and fasting for peace during lunch were, while inevitably political, more in line with his actual belief system.
7/23/18, 5:39 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: *partition; not lunch
7/23/18, 5:40 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: No one fasts during lunchtime
7/23/18, 5:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Glad you straightened that out!
7/23/18, 5:50 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.cobdencentre.org/2011/07/liberal-gandhi/
7/23/18, 5:52 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: And the alternative right view

7/23/18, 5:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You should read ambedkar on gandhi
7/23/18, 5:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He rips him apart and his level of politics
7/23/18, 5:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_FNSQcEx02A
7/23/18, 5:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/swarajyamag.com/amp/story/ideas%252Fdismantling-sainthood-ambedkar-on-gandhi

Some pretext
7/23/18, 6:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Khilafat movement üòÇ. The greatest blunder it was. 

It was an opportunistic act! Arun Shourie wrote about gandhi and Ali brothers. They had a very transactional relationship. Ali brothers after Khilafat were proponents of partition
7/23/18, 6:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhi believed in castes
7/23/18, 6:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He had a distinct view of religion in politics. He didn't separate them
7/23/18, 6:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
7/24/18, 3:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/24/18, 3:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: My friend sent this to me. 

@14043680303
7/24/18, 3:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kya message h isme
7/24/18, 4:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The individual, while important, does not rise above the collective.
7/24/18, 4:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Extremely stinging.
7/24/18, 4:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Need to read more about Ambedkar
7/24/18, 4:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar according to me saw the reality clearly
7/24/18, 4:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: However his solutions were not pragmatic
7/24/18, 4:52 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: He called a spade a spade
7/24/18, 4:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 4:53 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: That's not always the best idea if you want to rise to the top in politics, but you always need the folks who do, esp when writing the Constitution.
7/24/18, 4:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ambedkar writing the constitution is a hyperbole. 

He was the chairman of the drafting committee. It doesn't mean that he did all the wori. BN Rau was I thinking very instrumental in most of the conatitional aspects
7/24/18, 4:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Constitutional aspects *
7/24/18, 4:57 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah that's certainly true. Although you give the 'direction'. And are accountable.
7/24/18, 4:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Was just mentioning as people usually don't see this aspect
7/24/18, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But I really like ambedkar but not his ways
7/24/18, 4:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You should also read savarkar
7/24/18, 5:14 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: He's got PhDs from Columbia and LSE
7/24/18, 5:18 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: He did write a book where he supported the partition. That is supposed to have caused a significant impact.
7/24/18, 5:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He called out islamism too
7/24/18, 5:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/staying-in-school-genetics/565832/
7/24/18, 5:32 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yes he was opposed to discrimination.
7/24/18, 5:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/24/18, 5:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is what we call "virodhabhasi lekh"
7/24/18, 5:33 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're trying hard
7/24/18, 5:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The p value would have been more interesting
7/24/18, 5:34 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: ??
7/24/18, 5:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Someone said 

There are there are different levels of lies. First comes an ordinary lie, then comes political lies then comes statistics.
7/24/18, 5:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Counterintuitive
7/24/18, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He lost most elections
7/24/18, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Gandhi won all elections
7/24/18, 5:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Gandhi was a good politician
7/24/18, 5:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "Lies, damned lies, and statistics"üòÇ
7/24/18, 5:38 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The term was popularised in United States by Mark Twain (among others), who attributed it to the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."
7/24/18, 5:39 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: They're still saying that genetics is now more indicative than wealth for staying in school
7/24/18, 5:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
7/24/18, 5:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 5:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This quote
7/24/18, 5:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I've not read mark Twain. Have you?
7/24/18, 6:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn yes
7/24/18, 6:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
7/24/18, 6:59 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Exactly. But there are folks on the extreme political right who had popular appeal too. Including Bose.
7/24/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bose was extreme left
7/24/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wo to logo ko comrade bolta tha comrade Shubhayan
7/24/18, 7:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Political right i.e. fascist tendencies
7/24/18, 7:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 7:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Social left
7/24/18, 7:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan
7/24/18, 7:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah
7/24/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But he was definitely smarter than Nehru ji
7/24/18, 7:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And more courageous
7/24/18, 7:04 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Courage does not good leadership imply
7/24/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you know he actually won the elections in the haripura session of congress
7/24/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But Nehru complained to Gandhi. Gandhi ji became gussa and took it as prestige issue. 

Nehru ji played internal politics and ousted him using Gandhiji's support.
7/24/18, 7:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhiji resorted to extra-electoral instruments like political blackmailing. It is like when kids playing cricket say 'bat mera hai, mai out ho gaya to mai bat le kar jaa raha hun'
7/24/18, 7:09 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah, it was over the involvement of Indian troops in World War 2
7/24/18, 7:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 7:09 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Gandhi surprisingly supported it, Bose was opposed
7/24/18, 7:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/24/18, 7:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gandhiji was a good politician
7/24/18, 7:11 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: For what it's worth, Gandhi didn't seek any political office
7/24/18, 7:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hmmm
7/24/18, 7:11 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: He was committed to freedom of India
7/24/18, 7:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The means will always be debatable
7/24/18, 7:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Whether through peace or violence
7/24/18, 7:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hindsight is 20-20
7/24/18, 7:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Black Swan theory disagrees
7/24/18, 7:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ü§£
7/24/18, 7:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What the second best vision?
7/25/18, 12:09 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: That it's easy to give a false rationalization post the occurrence of a rare event
7/25/18, 12:11 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I don't see Nehru in the typical narrative. Mostly about Sitaramaya as a candidate for Gandhi.

7/25/18, 3:56 PM - Arpit Saxena: This has to be satire

7/25/18, 5:37 PM - Arpit Saxena: Or is it just assuming that there will be a backlash
7/25/18, 5:37 PM - Arpit Saxena: Us assuming*
7/25/18, 5:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: Who is more detached from reality
7/25/18, 5:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: they probably have a loyal clientele and dont a care much of public perception
7/25/18, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: Then why put it the duking hindu
7/25/18, 5:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: Fucking*
7/25/18, 5:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: so that interested people get on
7/25/18, 5:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its a matrimony service
7/25/18, 5:39 PM - Apoorv Umang: I think in indian arranged marriages boy has to be rich and girl pretty
7/25/18, 5:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: thats the essence of it
7/25/18, 5:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: I mean, u dont have dowry ads in newspapers even though that still happens
7/25/18, 5:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Isn't this almost as bad
7/25/18, 5:40 PM - Apoorv Umang: Why do you think this is bad vaise?
7/25/18, 5:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Atleast from a political point of view
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Politically correct*
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: rich guys wanting beautiful girls is a personal preference
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: dowry is illegal
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: what is the comparison dude
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Ok
7/25/18, 5:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Maybe not
7/25/18, 5:42 PM - Arpit Saxena: Matlab objectification of women is still there
7/25/18, 5:42 PM - Arpit Saxena: That's almost a crime today
7/25/18, 5:42 PM - Apoorv Umang: If you consider men and women equal, this is probably morally wrong
7/25/18, 5:43 PM - Apoorv Umang: So do you?
7/25/18, 5:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: equivocation fallacy
7/25/18, 5:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: the phrase men and women are equal
7/25/18, 5:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: if it means that men and women deserve equal respect and opportunities then i dont find anything wrong here
7/25/18, 5:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: you may question the taste
7/25/18, 5:49 PM - Arpit Saxena: What about objectification in that ad then
7/25/18, 5:49 PM - Arpit Saxena: Is that equal respect?
7/25/18, 5:50 PM - Arpit Saxena: They obviously don't care about successful women
7/25/18, 5:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its really unfortunate that people having preference for beautiful girls make you feel that its objectification
7/25/18, 5:50 PM - Arpit Saxena: I meant diff treatment of a ilities based on sex
7/25/18, 5:50 PM - Arpit Saxena: Abilities*
7/25/18, 5:50 PM - Arpit Saxena: I understand how it makes sense, just wondering
7/25/18, 5:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: see what i think of objectification is
7/25/18, 5:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: the term is so memed out
7/25/18, 5:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: they conflate everything with  objectification
7/25/18, 5:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: zz too much to write
7/25/18, 5:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ok so sexes are diffierent
7/25/18, 5:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: hence treatment can be different
7/25/18, 5:54 PM - Arpit Saxena: Youv have time
7/25/18, 5:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: they prefer beautiful women
7/25/18, 5:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its just that simple
7/25/18, 5:54 PM - Apoorv Umang: Personally, i think for a woman being pretty > being rich, opposite for men. This is how it is in society, and how i and maybe you also feel. Question is, is this right or wrong?
7/25/18, 5:55 PM - Arpit Saxena: For marriage
7/25/18, 5:55 PM - Apoorv Umang: Haan ofc
7/25/18, 5:56 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yeah, why does it sound sexist then
7/25/18, 5:56 PM - Arpit Saxena: If it was an ad for blind women and deaf men you wouldn't call that sexist
7/25/18, 5:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: outrage culture has distorted your vision
7/25/18, 5:56 PM - Apoorv Umang: Lol
7/25/18, 5:57 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: What about intelligent, understanding women > hot, golddiggin women?
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Apoorv Umang: No
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Arpit Saxena: I think it's the implied power structure that sounds sexist
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Well that answers it
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Arpit Saxena: Answers what?
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: This
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Arpit Saxena: ?
7/25/18, 5:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: YOU ARE NOT MAKING SENSE
7/25/18, 5:59 PM - Apoorv Umang: You have to add ugly also shubhayan
7/25/18, 5:59 PM - Apoorv Umang: To intelligent vala
7/25/18, 6:01 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Suppose we add 'plain-lookin'
7/25/18, 6:01 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Erm what was confusing?
7/25/18, 6:01 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: About this?
7/25/18, 6:02 PM - Apoorv Umang: Ugly mein kya problem hai?
7/25/18, 6:02 PM - Arpit Saxena: We thought it answered the question of sexism-or-not
7/25/18, 6:02 PM - Arpit Saxena: I thought*
7/25/18, 6:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: well i personally cant help but feel annoyed when i see a hot girl marry an ungly guy
7/25/18, 6:03 PM - Arpit Saxena: U will feel annoyed when any hot girl gets married :p
7/25/18, 6:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: but i dont think i should bring any morality angle to it if both of them consent
7/25/18, 6:05 PM - Apoorv Umang: How does ugly, intelligent and understanding compare to hot, dumb, gold digging for you?
7/25/18, 6:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: that would be arrogant
7/25/18, 6:05 PM - Arpit Saxena: That's the point, it still sounds wrong
7/25/18, 6:06 PM - Arpit Saxena: Or atleast something you're supposed to be disappointed in
7/25/18, 6:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: yes because of outrage culture im suspecting
7/25/18, 6:08 PM - Arpit Saxena: Even you are annoyed by it
7/25/18, 6:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: yes
7/25/18, 6:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You all are talking about patriarchal attitude of society. 

Will any rich, powerful and intelligent girl marry a hot, poor and dumb guy?
7/25/18, 6:09 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
7/25/18, 6:10 PM - Arpit Saxena: No, but we will applaud her if she does I guess
7/25/18, 6:10 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I can handle a lifetime of understanding and intelligent but not a lifetime of dumb and gold diggin
7/25/18, 6:10 PM - Arpit Saxena: Why judge anyone if they are consenting
7/25/18, 6:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: why?
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: stop with this pretentious moral high ground please
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Arpit Saxena: Dunno, but we won't judge her
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Arpit Saxena: The same way
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why not? Some actions are right or wrong in absolute terms.
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Arpit Saxena: Why is marrying a rich guy wrong
7/25/18, 6:11 PM - Arpit Saxena: What high ground? Just telling you how I would react, and most people too
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Same reason why we go for a high-paying job that we hate
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't say whether it is wrong or right. I am saying that we can judge.
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: We sell ourselves
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: your kids will be ugly XD
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yes, but almost all of us would judge it to be wrong
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: 10 toes does for me
7/25/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: your kids will be ugly XD
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Shubhayan needs grey matter
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: we can judge objective choice
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: but we cannot judge morally
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Apoorv Umang: I think we need a girl if we actually want to debate preferences
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: But if we can score and intelligent, understanding and hot woman, then well....
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Apoorv Umang: Lao koi ladki
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: *an
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No, this is a false argument.
7/25/18, 6:13 PM - Arpit Saxena: Essence of every conversation in this group
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Men can talk about women issues too if men are knowledgable.
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: no uterus no opinion boyyo!
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Hahaha üòÇüòÇ
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Arpit Saxena: Of course they can, just hard to remove bias
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Aniket Awasthi: At the end it is about knowledge and not the person who is talking about it
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Apoorv Umang: Kaise false bhai, how do you know a pretty girl likes or does not like ugly rich guys?
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Arpit Saxena: You can't just call yourself 'unhiased'
7/25/18, 6:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its impossible to remove bias
7/25/18, 6:15 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yes, which is why diversity is required...
7/25/18, 6:15 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: If she divorces him after 2 years and keeps the money
7/25/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They do like rich, ugly and powerful men.
7/25/18, 6:15 PM - Apoorv Umang: U dont know
7/25/18, 6:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I know; many of my female friends are like that
7/25/18, 6:16 PM - Apoorv Umang: 2nd hand knowledge
7/25/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They call themselves 'sapiosexual'
7/25/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 90% of knowledge is 2nd hand be
7/25/18, 6:17 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: üòÇ
7/25/18, 6:17 PM - Apoorv Umang: Not preferences,  they aare first hand
7/25/18, 6:18 PM - Apoorv Umang: Vaise meri uber trip khatam thx guys
7/25/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Is par actually ek economics par noble price mila tha Samuelson ko
7/25/18, 6:18 PM - Arpit Saxena: Still stuck in bus for another hour lol
7/25/18, 6:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Isi argument par; which you are saying
7/25/18, 6:18 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm
7/25/18, 6:19 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So he proved that preference can be revealed of an individual.
7/25/18, 6:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: the point is guys
7/25/18, 6:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference
7/25/18, 6:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: calling this phenomena sexist and objectification is purely outrage culture moral high ground preacher trash
7/25/18, 6:20 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Half an hour
7/25/18, 6:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its preferences arising from free will of individuals
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Arpit Saxena: Why does arranged marriage of bimbo/entrepreneur sound worse than arranged marriage of 2 doctors
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: lol; there's really no free will
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Arpit Saxena: Stfu with it buzzwords, just trying to figure out our reactions here
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I've heard this one before
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: bhai bhavna samjh le omg dont go philosohical on this one
7/25/18, 6:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ok
7/25/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: holy shit aniket just went friedrich nietzsche on me
7/25/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: nahi be
7/25/18, 6:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: which community has best arranged marriage  girls
7/25/18, 6:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: gujarati?
7/25/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Which context?
7/25/18, 6:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: hot girls ofcourse
7/25/18, 6:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: itsnt it established that guys prefer beauty
7/25/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Money, dowry, looks, character?
7/25/18, 6:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Sindhi, punjabi, pahadi brahmins, have the best looking girls.
7/25/18, 6:30 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Indori. Hands down.
7/25/18, 6:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: never imagined id be accused of using buzzwords
7/25/18, 6:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: i guess you are right
7/25/18, 6:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: but in my defence they are not entirely meaningless
7/25/18, 6:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: Maybe, but it's only noise in this discussion
7/25/18, 6:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: Doesn't add anything meaningful
7/25/18, 6:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: Also the former atleast has sexual attraction to begin with
7/25/18, 6:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: Rest of the process is probably identical for any arranged marriage
7/25/18, 6:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: one sided
7/25/18, 6:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: Not according to aniket
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Didn't get you
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Sapiosexyal?
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: you said somehing about sapio
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: fuck
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Doesn't that imply sexual attraction
7/25/18, 6:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, some people are attracted towards intelligence
7/25/18, 6:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Wohi
7/25/18, 6:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Not one sided then
7/25/18, 6:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
7/25/18, 6:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I think, rohan is very much objective about looks and effect of looks on sexual attraction. Are you @919422709999 ?
7/25/18, 6:42 PM - Arpit Saxena: Isn't everyone
7/25/18, 6:42 PM - Arpit Saxena: Or was that sarcasm
7/25/18, 6:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: yes but i ESPECIALLLY am :D
7/25/18, 6:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Most of the men are but not all
7/25/18, 6:43 PM - Arpit Saxena: What?
7/25/18, 6:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Most of the men pay disproportionate attention towards looks but not all men do that
7/25/18, 6:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: brb
7/25/18, 6:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: nooooooooo
7/25/18, 6:45 PM - Arpit Saxena: 5% üîã gn guys
7/25/18, 6:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: i have noticed
7/25/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: is arpit more interested in talking about gender issues
7/25/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: i remember our time in manali he was more passionate in discussing gender issues
7/25/18, 6:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: I stay away from all political issues
7/25/18, 6:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: Including this
7/25/18, 6:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: Dunno how I got into it
7/25/18, 6:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: but this isnt political
7/25/18, 6:47 PM - Arpit Saxena: Well u get what I mean
7/25/18, 6:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: then wtf do you even talk about you fucking robot
7/25/18, 6:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: Normal stuff?
7/25/18, 6:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: Books/movies/video games?
7/25/18, 6:49 PM - Arpit Saxena: I'm sure you'll be that dadaji who keeps talking about the state of politics all the time
7/25/18, 6:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: üòÇüòÇüòÇ burned
7/25/18, 6:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: shit i gotta keep my robophobia in check guys
7/25/18, 6:50 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Guys consider talking about girls normal stuff
7/25/18, 6:50 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yes, but not gender differences and shit
7/25/18, 6:51 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Except when Nietchism is used
7/25/18, 6:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: you're the one to talk when a gender issue got you talking in the group
7/25/18, 6:52 PM - Arpit Saxena: I just said I don't know how I got into this
7/25/18, 6:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: wtf
7/25/18, 6:53 PM - Arpit Saxena: Maybe cuz I'm bored in a bus for 2 hours
7/25/18, 6:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: its irrelevant cuz you did!
7/25/18, 6:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ok ok fine
7/25/18, 6:53 PM - Arpit Saxena: It's not the first gender issue brought up here I'm sure
7/25/18, 6:55 PM - Arpit Saxena: I mean I'm still curious about it but these discussions go nowhere
7/25/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: when do you think the discussion goes somehwere?
7/25/18, 6:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: when someone agrees with you?
7/25/18, 6:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: I mean gender discussions always devolve into the same things
7/25/18, 6:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I do agree and concede if I was wrong
7/25/18, 6:59 PM - Arpit Saxena: Nothing productive comes out of it
7/25/18, 6:59 PM - Arpit Saxena: It's repetitive
7/25/18, 6:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: In short run
7/25/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's more about food for thought
7/25/18, 7:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Which in long run can influence your thought process
7/25/18, 7:01 PM - Arpit Saxena: Always the same food
7/25/18, 7:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Is it?
7/25/18, 7:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Think again
7/25/18, 7:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: i think you are being cynical arpit
7/25/18, 7:04 PM - Arpit Saxena: Why
7/25/18, 7:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: On arpits defense there's a definite need to raise the quality of discourse
7/25/18, 7:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But the quality of discussion here is good
7/25/18, 7:06 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Mainly due to diverse opinions
7/25/18, 7:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: Not that diverse
7/25/18, 7:10 PM - Arpit Saxena: It's not even about that
7/25/18, 7:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I disagree
7/25/18, 7:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I've even mentioned that you're wrong. Things aren't repetitive
7/25/18, 7:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Gave you an example too
7/26/18, 5:08 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://youtu.be/n5h0qHwNrHk
7/26/18, 9:24 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The opening scene reminded me of the service Arpit and gang were trying to develop
7/26/18, 9:25 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Which was that?
7/26/18, 9:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
7/26/18, 9:29 AM - Rohan Bhamre: *you do
7/26/18, 9:30 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Lauren southern btw
7/26/18, 9:36 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I guess he will explain
7/26/18, 9:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: She's average looking üòõ
7/26/18, 9:50 AM - Rohan Bhamre: If this is the average looking blonde girl
7/26/18, 9:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: What the fuck am I doing in India
7/26/18, 9:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Fuck this shit I'm out
7/26/18, 9:52 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm coming for an MBA even if I don't need or want one
7/26/18, 9:52 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think San Diego is the place to be. That place is full of pretty sights.
7/26/18, 9:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hot girls + sick music scene + paradise weather
7/26/18, 9:54 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Don't go to Harvard and shit. If you go to a nice tier 2 or 3 State University you'll get at least 5 better than that in your class.
7/26/18, 9:57 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Why are blondes so disproportionately hot
7/26/18, 9:57 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Make up and workout culture?
7/26/18, 9:58 AM - Arpit Saxena: Wow good morning
7/26/18, 9:58 AM - Arpit Saxena: Itni jaldi uttha hai rohn
7/26/18, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Gtfo dude we aren't talking your normal size stuff
7/26/18, 9:59 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I don't think they are. Brunettes are equally. 
Yes. They do a lot of biking, hiking, gym etc
7/26/18, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: *normal stuff
7/26/18, 9:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: By blondes I really mean whites. Sorry for the misnomer
7/26/18, 10:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It goes for men too. White men and women have just better features. Lighter skin and eyes + nealry 70 percent kids start hitting the gym from high school.

7/26/18, 10:08 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I taught first year undergrad for a whole year. Got to know so much about their culture. It's a whole different ball game which plays a huge part in fitness during adult life
7/26/18, 10:18 AM - Rohan Bhamre: so you think lighter skin is more attractive
7/26/18, 10:18 AM - Rohan Bhamre: racist!

7/26/18, 3:25 PM - Kartik Vermun: I was childhood obese
7/26/18, 3:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is obesity and not overweight
7/26/18, 3:26 PM - Kartik Vermun: Hmm
7/26/18, 3:26 PM - Kartik Vermun: Fair point
7/26/18, 3:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
7/26/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So about 35-40% obese and overweight

7/26/18, 4:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Is it related to race or people who are born and brought up there are in general mean?
7/26/18, 4:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Average=Mean
7/26/18, 4:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ya Al-uuuh. Tauba tauba
7/26/18, 4:29 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Though average can actually refer to any measure of central tendency

7/28/18, 2:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Women reservation also
7/28/18, 2:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not in parliament and vidhan sabha
7/28/18, 2:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Just in local bodies
7/28/18, 2:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Doesn't matter right if it's a reserved seat?
7/28/18, 2:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I think they have reservations for tickets
7/28/18, 2:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not for seats

8/7/18, 7:21 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Guys I've been reading a lot of history the past few weeks (John Keay, Romila Thapar). I think I'm leaning towards the Congress ideology of secularism. üòÇ
Do you think the Aryan invasion theory (whether partially or completely true) in any way relevant in establishing identity today?
8/7/18, 7:21 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Aryan invasion/migration is true
8/7/18, 7:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: However the evidences which RT presents are very controversial. 

Recently there's a genetic study of mitochondrial dna and normal dna
8/7/18, 7:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Which proved that there are 3 main groups in india
8/7/18, 7:23 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Onge
Indus valley 
Steppe
8/7/18, 7:23 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So Harappans are Dravidian if the chronolgy of the invasions is to make sense?
8/7/18, 7:24 AM - Aniket Awasthi: No
8/7/18, 7:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Oh okay. What are Onge and steppe?
8/7/18, 7:24 AM - Aniket Awasthi: This is wrong
8/7/18, 7:24 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Onge is negroid race
8/7/18, 7:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Migrated from sub-sahran Africa?
8/7/18, 7:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 7:25 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So what are Industry valley people then? Their script wasn't Sanskrit so they predated Aryans for sure
8/7/18, 7:27 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Right now don't bring philology into the discussion. Philological evidences are weak to prove much. Genetic evidences are stronger
8/7/18, 7:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay. It's just so confusing to make sense of the chronolgy.
8/7/18, 7:28 AM - Aniket Awasthi: There were two main categories 

Ancestrally north Indians 
Ancestrally south Indian
8/7/18, 7:29 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: This is cool. I'm pretty Aryan üòõ
8/7/18, 7:29 AM - Aniket Awasthi: These are formed by admixture of these three
8/7/18, 7:29 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Nothing to be proud about Waise
8/7/18, 7:29 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: No just a trivia fact
8/7/18, 7:29 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok. Got it wrong
8/7/18, 7:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: The box are the first settlers of India
8/7/18, 7:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Aasi = onge genes
8/7/18, 7:31 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Which was all over India or south/north predominant?
8/7/18, 7:32 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay
8/7/18, 7:33 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 7:33 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Now if you infer from this. The society today is highly mixed
8/7/18, 7:33 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Across the castes structure
8/7/18, 7:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Every caste will have a variety of gene pools
8/7/18, 7:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Obviously there will be exceptions mainly due to geography
8/7/18, 7:34 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So no one is Aryan/Dravidian and their genetics are highly mixed if I understood it correctly?
8/7/18, 7:34 AM - Aniket Awasthi: In general yes.
8/7/18, 7:35 AM - Aniket Awasthi: However there are significant differences
8/7/18, 7:35 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Upper castes tend to have more of steppe genes
8/7/18, 7:37 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Do we know the origin of the onge i.e how they migrated to the subcontinent?
8/7/18, 7:37 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay this makes a lot more sense than the philological chronology I read with John Keay for placement of historical perioda
8/7/18, 7:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 7:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 7:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 7:38 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They walked
8/7/18, 7:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: But not from the Steppes?
8/7/18, 7:39 AM - Aniket Awasthi: From Africa
8/7/18, 7:39 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Currently we haven't found any human fossil older than what we have found in Ethiopia
8/7/18, 7:39 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Isn't it the same route then as the Aryans from the Himalayan passes?
8/7/18, 7:40 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Just at a different time maybe
8/7/18, 7:40 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Recently there's a news of Chinese human older than this but it's still under debate. 

So Africa is the cradle of human specie
8/7/18, 7:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Aryans are steppe people
8/7/18, 7:41 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Homo erectus?
8/7/18, 7:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Not exactly. Aryan is actually a term used for a linguistic community which spoke proto sanskrit. 

That's why in genetic study people use steppe rather than aryan
8/7/18, 7:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: To remain exact
8/7/18, 7:42 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Homo sapiens
8/7/18, 7:42 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes but the migration of both into India( steppe and onge) is from the Himalayan passes correct?
8/7/18, 7:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Himalayan nahi. It's from Hindu kush
8/7/18, 7:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Khyber pass
8/7/18, 7:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: And also from Iran
8/7/18, 7:43 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Directly
8/7/18, 7:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But don't read too much of romilla thapar
8/7/18, 7:44 AM - Aniket Awasthi: She's a sloppy historian
8/7/18, 7:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes. Sorry I don't know they were separate ranges. I learnt something!
8/7/18, 7:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: She's an indologist who can't understand sanskrit
8/7/18, 7:45 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: No I've just been reading Keay. Just read an arcticle from her
8/7/18, 7:45 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
8/7/18, 7:46 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But dravida itself is a wrong group
8/7/18, 7:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: If you speak in normal terms. 

Aasi people are the original inhabitants of India
8/7/18, 7:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Indus valley people are from Iran
8/7/18, 7:47 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They migrated to sindh and punjab from Iran
8/7/18, 7:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Now, there was a drought like condition about 4000 years back ( this is the start of what we call "meghalayan age"). So ivc people had to shift southward
8/7/18, 7:49 AM - Aniket Awasthi: At the same time steppe people also migrated
8/7/18, 7:49 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So the language Sanskrit was eventually an assmilation of all 3 in varying amounts?
8/7/18, 7:50 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So dravida (red) are a mixture of ivc + onge
8/7/18, 7:50 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay nice.
8/7/18, 7:51 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Can't say. But most probably sanskrit is independent
8/7/18, 7:51 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Similarly north Indians = steppe + indus valley
8/7/18, 7:51 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So the indus valley is found all throughout India
8/7/18, 7:52 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not enough preserved ancient text to construct a philological chronology?
8/7/18, 7:52 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Rig ved is the oldest written text
8/7/18, 7:52 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's interesting that their city planning didn't carry through as they migrated
8/7/18, 7:53 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But as these are "shruti" texts. They were transmitted via voice. They were passed on through generations and it was very later on when they were actually written
8/7/18, 7:53 AM - Aniket Awasthi: That's because of meghalayan age
8/7/18, 7:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: There were severe drought like conditions around 4000 years ago throughout the world
8/7/18, 7:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Most of the urban centers vanished
8/7/18, 7:54 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Mostly the rural population would have migrated as they would have been tougher than the urban population
8/7/18, 7:56 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see. That makes a lot of sense. Essentially we don't know much about the period when this Meghalayan draught started to when the Rig Veda was written to know how language evolved in between?
8/7/18, 7:57 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Symbols to written texts i.e since permanent settlements weren't the norm and nomadic people were predominant?
8/7/18, 7:57 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: While the draught was prevalent
8/7/18, 7:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Indus valley script hasn't been decipherd yet
8/7/18, 7:57 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So we can't say
8/7/18, 7:58 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I know but I read certain articles its symbols being more similar to some South Indian scripts than sanskrit
8/7/18, 7:58 AM - Aniket Awasthi: But answering the core question. Yes, there was aryan migration to India
8/7/18, 7:59 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Scripts and languages shouldn't be confused Waise
8/7/18, 7:59 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Conspiracy theories. Iv script ke baare me kuch nahi Pata hai. Literally
8/7/18, 8:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I meant the nagari lipi not Sanskrit  I.e
8/7/18, 8:00 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Nagri lipi is very recent
8/7/18, 8:00 AM - Aniket Awasthi: 1200 years max
8/7/18, 8:00 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay. I find a lot of historical revisionism mixed with jingoism from Desi authora
8/7/18, 8:00 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Earliest script we know is bhrami script
8/7/18, 8:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Trying to construct modern identity from sketchy historical narratives rather than telling facts. Someone like Romila Thapar
8/7/18, 8:01 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see
8/7/18, 8:02 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan. Marxist ideology hai
8/7/18, 8:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways. Thanks! I learnt a lot and clarified a lot of things
8/7/18, 8:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 8:05 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Some people say this
8/7/18, 8:06 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Script and language shouldn't be confused. 

Ye Mai Hindi Roman script me bhi likh sakta hun. Isse language change nahi hoti hai
8/7/18, 8:21 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that's a very nice chart too
. I hadn't seen it
8/7/18, 12:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Race cannot be isolated. Especially in a place like India
8/7/18, 12:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Good "thread"
8/9/18, 12:03 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Another interesting observation as I read further into the Mauryan period is that Buddhism and Jainism were not 'religons' in the modern notion of the word but rather more like a code of behaviour and a way to live life as shown by some successful people. Very different from Islam and Christianity. Is that a correct interpretation?
8/9/18, 12:05 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. No eastern religion can be compared with Islam or Christianity
8/9/18, 12:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But they were religions as a whole. They had their own meta physics, rules, priests, vihars and temples
8/9/18, 12:08 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I see.
8/9/18, 12:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: After ashoka, bhuddism had a major text called abhidham pitka which were philosophy and rules to be followed
8/9/18, 12:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ashoka used it to make societal laws and he use to enforce those laws using bureaucracy and religious police
8/9/18, 12:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Dhamma mahaamatya they were called
8/9/18, 12:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Laws were very intrusive too. Like ban on Bali of animals, promotion of duty towards parents, validity of religious police and state policy of proselytization
8/9/18, 2:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Academically it's known that Dharm and religion do not have interchangeable meanings
8/9/18, 2:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Speaking of Buddhism. Can you imagine that modern day Afghanistan once had a dominant presence of Buddhism
8/9/18, 7:30 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I read about that. I suppose they were made to tie the huge empire into a cohesive one but didn't last long after ashoka
8/9/18, 7:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Dharms literal meaning is duty right not religion?
8/9/18, 7:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: The religion one seems to be a more westerns interpretation of it
8/9/18, 7:47 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
8/10/18, 3:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I am absolutely astonished to see the number of such posts on this subreddit
8/10/18, 3:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kids having financial conflicts with their parents

8/10/18, 3:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Has parenting taken an ugly turn in the West
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Such scenarios are seen in India too
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is very common
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can't judge a society on the basis of a few incidences
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's not
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I kind of check though subreddit daily
8/10/18, 3:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Pretty common posts
8/10/18, 3:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Reddit again is a very non reliable source
8/10/18, 3:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not upvoted much though
8/10/18, 3:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Plus only motivated people join
8/10/18, 3:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Acha
8/10/18, 3:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Western parenting is still fine; at least in whites
8/10/18, 3:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Blacks have been known not to be good parents. They leave their wife/girlfriends when she has a baby
8/10/18, 3:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That's known to the point of being joked about
8/10/18, 3:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
8/10/18, 4:53 PM - Apoorv Umang: @919422709999  would you help your dad pay bills in this situation?

8/10/18, 4:55 PM - Apoorv Umang: Sup nibba
8/10/18, 4:57 PM - Apoorv Umang: I would probably loan him, definitely not give for free
8/10/18, 8:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: If he's living in the same apartment, and earning, well.. you gotta pay your share of the bills.
8/10/18, 8:53 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It seems the guy in the post already has made his decision the way he described his parents lifestyle. I bet there is more to the story.

This guy for some reason reminds me of srihari(maybe the hairstyle)

8/21/18, 3:28 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Good imam üòä
8/21/18, 3:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hogwash
8/21/18, 3:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He says Allah's Islam is what should be followed
8/21/18, 3:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And not mullah's Islam
8/21/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So he wants to follow just quran
8/21/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And reject all other hadis and other texts
8/21/18, 3:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But quran in itself is very sectarian and divisive
8/21/18, 3:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unless he is taqqiyaing us
8/21/18, 3:33 PM - Rohan Bhamre: His attitude is pretty secular and humanitarian
8/21/18, 3:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But it's better than others I'll say
8/21/18, 3:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: One step at a time
8/21/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Guys
8/21/18, 3:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ?
8/21/18, 5:02 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Right-wing fringe hollers out the center. While the centre remains apologetic supporters.

8/21/18, 5:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Didn't know this
8/21/18, 5:56 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah it's pretty amazing to think of the sources where they are keeping and retrieving all this information.
8/21/18, 5:57 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braj_Kumar_Nehru

8/21/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What about him?
8/21/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I know these two
8/21/18, 6:32 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: RSS stayed aloof from independence movement. Now claims the spoils, including Patel.
8/21/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
8/21/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do they claim patel?
8/21/18, 6:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Or do they claim independence?
8/21/18, 6:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: BJP does that, Rss doesn't
8/21/18, 8:28 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah reread history, Patel had banned the RSS
8/21/18, 8:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: ok
8/21/18, 8:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Afaik RSS stayed away from politics till 1960s
8/21/18, 8:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't suppose that should stop them from participating in independence struggle because independence was a more than a political movement
8/21/18, 8:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But then apart from Congress no organisation took part in freedom struggle
8/21/18, 8:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I may be wrong
8/21/18, 8:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Which brings us back to the same point.
8/21/18, 8:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Indians were not nearly as enthusiastic about independence as our textbooks would have us claim
8/21/18, 8:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But apart from RSS duties the sanghis did participate in their personal capacity towards independence
8/21/18, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What people don't see is  that RSS was founded in 1920s. When the freedom struggle intensified they were still small.
8/21/18, 8:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This seems to be their official stance; but they weren't apolitical.
8/21/18, 8:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I think shubhayan has confused participating in Quit India movement with independence struggle. Am I wrong? 

Also Quit India Movement was a disaster, nothing came out of it. The british were shaken by the mutiny by RIN and also by army.
8/21/18, 8:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have no idea why shubhayan shared Kumar nehru
8/21/18, 8:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Am I missing something?
8/21/18, 8:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He represented India in the 'Sterlings balances' negotiations with Britain at the post-Second World War reparations conference.[12]
8/21/18, 8:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ok
8/21/18, 8:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sorry I am an economics noob
8/21/18, 8:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sterling balances just going over my head
8/21/18, 9:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhai please I don't think the acronym rin should be assumed to be known by others here
8/21/18, 9:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Royal Indian Navy
8/21/18, 9:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Aree matlab Indian and European banks had a lot of liabilities of each other.

8/24/18, 8:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Exactly
8/24/18, 8:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Also ai was doing one unique thing. They were portraying aggressive even though their abilities were in cd
8/24/18, 8:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Humans backed off a lot of times because of this bluff
8/24/18, 8:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I was hoping for metas to develop from this
8/24/18, 8:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So far I only see salve tactic
8/24/18, 8:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Any other meta practices by bots?
8/24/18, 8:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ignored
8/24/18, 8:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm gonna get ignored nowüòî
8/24/18, 9:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nothing very prominent

8/25/18, 10:02 AM - Arpit Saxena: Ghar pe no kaam?
8/25/18, 10:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Life is so much more productive without it
8/25/18, 10:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Nope.
8/25/18, 10:02 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Other than taking calls

8/25/18, 10:08 AM - Rohan Bhamre: It's like no fap
8/25/18, 10:08 AM - Rohan Bhamre: No lap
8/25/18, 10:08 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Good work Ambi proud of you
8/25/18, 10:09 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Now I know what you watch on YouTube
8/25/18, 10:11 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Though I watched this yesterday so am no better. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KBuJA5EqU9s&t=399s
8/26/18, 1:48 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Hey guys! I had a question about corporate law and Vijay Mallyas case with his F1 team. I was wondering if anyone is good at these legal things?
8/26/18, 1:48 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Tell me
8/26/18, 1:55 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So Mallya had shares in Force India(his F1 team). Recently the team went into administration( I think it's the UK term for bankruptcy?) due to money owed to creditors. The team was rescued by a consortium lead by a Brazillian investor. The administrator needed the approval of 13 Indian banks which has a wordwide freeze on Vijay Mallya associated entities. However, it circumvented that by selling Force India's assets. I can't seem to understand how you can't buy the team Force India itself (by buying the shares) but still legally in fact buy it by paying for it's assets? Here's more on the topic:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2018/08/25/f1-on-track-for-legal-battle-next-month-over-force-india-sale/amp/
8/26/18, 2:06 AM - Aniket Awasthi: So it is a bankruptcy case of a UK based company which is governed by UK laws.

Technically, the firm filed for bankruptcy. So this is a matter between the creditors and the prospective buyers. 

While the promotor of the company is meanwhile free to do administrative tasks.

However, the promoter can't do such a task after the resolution/restructuring/liquidation has been processed by the court(here administration).
8/26/18, 2:08 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Then this case will be tried further under 'wilful defaulter' regime. If UK has such laws.

For that the current creditors will have to prove that Promoter of the firm is a wilful defaulter and hence his other assets can be attached in the bankruptcy process.
8/26/18, 2:10 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Whats the promoter of the company?
8/26/18, 2:10 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Is it the administrator(FRP)?
8/26/18, 2:11 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Promotor of a company is the person who raised all the funds and is often incharge of the company
8/26/18, 2:11 AM - Aniket Awasthi: He/she takes the important strategic decisions of the company's functioning
8/26/18, 2:12 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: So Vijay Mallya in this case right?
8/26/18, 2:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: It is comparable to MD/CEO etc however, promotor usually has a lot of stake in the company's ownership too
8/26/18, 2:12 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
8/26/18, 2:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: MOst probably
8/26/18, 2:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: As he in incharge of the administration of the company
8/26/18, 2:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: You can think of the promoter of a company as a person who is the boss of CEO
8/26/18, 2:13 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Jaise Elon Musk
8/26/18, 2:14 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Even though he doesn't have a substantial ownership of the company
8/26/18, 2:19 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that makes sense. But I still don't understand how the court appointed administrator(FRP) needed approval of Indian banks to sell Mallyas shares but  could sell the assets of the company without approval. Isn't the value of those shares through the assets? Aren't they the same thing?

So Mallya was a wilful defaulter. But now that another investor has legally bought those assets, Indian banks have no way to recover the money through those assets. Isn't that Money laundering? But through the UK court system(administration process)
8/26/18, 2:20 AM - Aniket Awasthi: I am not privy to the UK's handling of such situations. But I am guessing that UK is one of the most transparent laws in this field as it houses the London Stock Exchange.
8/26/18, 2:21 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, creditors will have to file a case here against mallya to prove him as wilful defaulter
8/26/18, 2:22 AM - Aniket Awasthi: BTW, the consortium of banks were not the creditors of the Force India. They became the creditors of force India as Mallya diverted money from Kingfisher to Force India
8/26/18, 2:23 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes that's why the administrator s first priority was to the creditors of Force India and not Vijay Mallya
8/26/18, 2:24 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: But the distinction between shares and assets isn't something very clear to me
8/26/18, 2:24 AM - Aniket Awasthi: They have a precedence order when it comes to liquidation of assets
8/26/18, 2:25 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Creditors(preferential share) > Creditors(non preferential share)> outstanding debt owners> outstanding payments and so on
8/26/18, 2:28 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay that makes a lot of sense
8/26/18, 2:28 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
8/26/18, 2:30 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Shares are the percent of your ownership of the firm. Assets are what firm owns.
8/26/18, 2:38 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yup but I meant in the transfer of ownership. So if an investor buy Force India's shares and now owns that company it has to get approval.(due to it's previous owners liabilities).  But if it creates a new firm it can still buy the assets due to the bankruptcy process at play. Sounds like a legal loophole to attain the same objective but with lesser hassles
8/26/18, 2:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: NOt a loophole; this is the text book case of fraud.
8/26/18, 2:41 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Law covers it
8/26/18, 2:57 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Okay I think I understand it now.
8/26/18, 3:03 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Thanks dude! You are the man!
8/26/18, 3:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: Excessive mannerism...
8/26/18, 3:04 AM - Aniket Awasthi: :P
8/26/18, 3:04 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yeah bad habit I have started to acquire here as I talk to consultants and clients here üòõ

8/26/18, 9:49 AM - Rohan Bhamre: The habit of excessive gratitude expression is insufferable

8/27/18, 5:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: As I mentioned he is like Dawkins, who I don't find very practical
8/27/18, 5:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You are looking for solution based talk
8/27/18, 5:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He doesn't give a solution. He gives a diagnosis
8/27/18, 5:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In this talk that is
8/27/18, 5:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. This is the reason

9/1/18, 9:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Noice
9/1/18, 9:46 PM - Kartik Vermun: And when do you guys think ie?
9/1/18, 9:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: October?
9/1/18, 9:46 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'll come to Bangalore
9/1/18, 9:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Take note boys
9/1/18, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Clear your schedule
9/1/18, 9:47 PM - Kartik Vermun: South East Aida trip?
9/1/18, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Why are you going bangy
9/1/18, 9:47 PM - Kartik Vermun: *Asia
9/1/18, 9:47 PM - Kartik Vermun: Lol
9/1/18, 9:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Because most of the people are there
9/3/18, 8:33 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: What are you guys thoughts on the simulated reality argument?
9/3/18, 8:50 AM - Rohan Bhamre: We have probably spoken a bit about this
9/3/18, 8:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: But only after getting sufficiently drunk üò¨
9/3/18, 8:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: *in manali
9/3/18, 8:53 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I remember. I read some comments recently about how some people are still in the flat Earth patch while others have now updated to quantum theory one. üòõ
9/3/18, 8:54 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Though quantum theory is too eerily similar to how games are modeled and have glitches
9/3/18, 8:57 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I for one am interested to know about the ethical conflicts that would arise usage of simulated reality
9/3/18, 8:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Too bad that's never going to happen
9/3/18, 8:58 AM - Rohan Bhamre: In my lifetime*
9/3/18, 8:59 AM - Ambikesh Mishra: Wouldn't it make sense for people with incurable mental illnesses or really old people
9/3/18, 8:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And the ramifications in philosophy
9/3/18, 8:59 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Oh my
9/5/18, 2:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey guys
9/5/18, 2:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I just spoke to the exposed Hindu bigot Jayant Sinha
9/5/18, 2:52 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He was giving me life advice
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: What was it?
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: While placing emphasis on reading a lot
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He gave me a list of 10 books to read
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unsurprisingly the first one in the list was Bhagwat geeta
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What a sanghi
9/5/18, 2:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Have you read BG?
9/5/18, 2:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: (being sarcastic)
9/5/18, 2:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: BG is nice, if nothing else it is chronological
9/5/18, 2:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I would guess so
9/5/18, 2:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When I read the quran, it was just random.
9/5/18, 2:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
9/5/18, 2:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is not in chronological. So I had to get another edited one which was in chronological order
9/5/18, 2:56 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Allhamdullillah
9/5/18, 2:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye land of seven rivers
9/5/18, 2:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye land of seven rivers is kind of amateur work
9/5/18, 2:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Thoda factual issues hain us book me
9/5/18, 2:57 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Have you read all
9/5/18, 2:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So cross that out; Sanjeev Sanyal wrote that book. He is a finance/economics guy.
9/5/18, 2:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: YEs
9/5/18, 2:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Life of Pi nahi
9/5/18, 2:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Rest all I have read it
9/5/18, 2:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Making of Indian Constitution üòÇ
9/5/18, 3:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I abhor any document which is produced by lawyers.
9/5/18, 3:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Solely by *
9/5/18, 3:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You know

9/5/18, 3:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Milords
9/5/18, 3:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Solid waste management par; construction hi ban kar diya
9/5/18, 3:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hiking banned in Uttarakhand
9/5/18, 3:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Rafting bannedü§£
9/5/18, 3:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ye lawyers logo ka dimag hai aisa; Inhi logo ne Indian constitution likha hai

Very sloppy document I would say
9/5/18, 3:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Who will go to Uttarakhand now
9/5/18, 3:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: #LawyerDimag
9/5/18, 3:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Our constituent assembly had a majority of lawyers BTW
9/5/18, 3:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Probably Ambedkar was one of the sane voices there as he wasn't really a lawyer
9/5/18, 3:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Guys please don't think of Jayant Sinha as a bigot
9/5/18, 3:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Even today 60-70% of the cabinet is made of lawyers
9/5/18, 3:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Chinese Communist Party has 80% engineers at the top
9/5/18, 3:05 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This guy is MBA from Harvard
9/5/18, 3:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I know academical accolades do not predispose political agendas
9/5/18, 3:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But he seemed like a principaled man to me
9/5/18, 3:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Unworthy of bigotry
9/5/18, 3:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Personally I won't judge anyone this easily
9/5/18, 3:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you know Pol Pot?
9/5/18, 3:08 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have not read Communist Chinese history so no
9/5/18, 3:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was all these qualities that you mentioned.
9/5/18, 3:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Khmer Rogue ka naam suna hoga. Pol Pot was the leader of that
9/5/18, 3:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Cambodia me
9/5/18, 3:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He was a well learnt, very soft spoken, disciplined, emotional and soft hearted man. When he was a teacher, people say that he use to cry avidly on small things.
9/5/18, 3:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He turned out to be one of the biggest Genocide perpetrators in modern history
9/5/18, 3:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I have not spoken to pol pot so I can't say Aniket
9/5/18, 3:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Nahi, I am saying that these qualities that you've mentioned are not a yard stick to know if someone is a bigot
9/5/18, 3:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: True
9/5/18, 3:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But I asked my dad why would Jayant Sinha garland convicts
9/5/18, 3:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That was for political gain
9/5/18, 3:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dad thinks Sinha didn't know who was garlanding
9/5/18, 3:15 PM - Aniket Awasthi: RG is going on Kailash Yatra; it is also for political gain
9/5/18, 3:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Kailash Yatra and garlanding convicts is different
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: True
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But I think it is for political gain
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Cuz these ministers go to local functions on behalf of parties.
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Jharkhand is a very religious place
9/5/18, 3:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok
9/5/18, 3:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And any tom dick harry comes on stage at local places
9/5/18, 3:18 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes, that can be very well true
9/5/18, 3:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My dad also goes
9/5/18, 3:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He is so busy he just wants to get done with the event and go ahead with schedule
9/5/18, 3:19 PM - Rohan Bhamre: This shit can happen to my father as well
9/5/18, 3:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
9/5/18, 3:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: True
9/5/18, 3:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I agree
9/5/18, 3:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Could he have said that he didn't know them later on?
9/5/18, 3:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Even I thought that
9/5/18, 3:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Maybe he thought playing dumb would come across worse
9/5/18, 3:21 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That would have angered his constituency too
9/5/18, 3:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's local event
9/5/18, 3:21 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yeah
9/5/18, 3:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Dude have you actually read Quran in its entirety
9/5/18, 3:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
9/5/18, 3:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not the original one
9/5/18, 3:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Original form is totally random, it can't be comprehended
9/5/18, 3:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's a convenient feature for the absurd
9/5/18, 3:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: http://mquran.org/content/view/527/4/
9/5/18, 3:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Read the successive verses
9/5/18, 3:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You'll know it is not in chronology
9/5/18, 6:09 PM - Apoorv Umang: How do you beat someone without hitting them in the face? Stomach?
9/6/18, 12:44 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wtf?
9/6/18, 12:44 PM - Apoorv Umang: That mquran verse
9/6/18, 7:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hey bhagwaan
9/6/18, 7:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÇ
9/6/18, 7:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Did you see the new few verses @917891947877 ?
9/6/18, 7:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bilkul incoherent hai;
9/6/18, 7:56 PM - Apoorv Umang: Yeah
9/6/18, 7:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Many islamists just directly quote random verses to radicalise people
9/6/18, 7:57 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When people question them out; they say that 'it is out of context'
9/6/18, 7:58 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It is a major drawback of quran; it is randomly arranged.
9/6/18, 9:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You mean like when the Quran calls for conquest against infidels and some dudes kill infidels in the name of jihad and people bitch about jihad then Islamists say jihad is actually an 'internal struggle' of a person
9/6/18, 9:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't actually know if there are such explicit instructions of destruction against infidels in the Quran. Are there any@Aniket

9/6/18, 9:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Haha
9/6/18, 9:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: Surpsingly RSS supports it
9/6/18, 9:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: To some extent
9/6/18, 9:40 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah they support decriminalization of homesexuality, but are against same-sex marriages

9/6/18, 9:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I for one am against criminalization of homosexuality but against normalisation of the same
9/6/18, 9:41 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Better than the endless tirade against Islamists üëª
9/6/18, 9:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: It's more fun
9/6/18, 9:41 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Nothing follows the normal distribution
9/6/18, 9:42 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah yeah...
9/6/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not just that. It's more relevant
9/6/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: To a much higher degree than you'd imagine
9/6/18, 9:44 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: I stick with 3D
9/6/18, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I dislike naturalist arguments
9/6/18, 9:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The assertion that if something is natural hence good, and the unnatural the bad
9/6/18, 9:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Has no basis in humanity
9/6/18, 9:49 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: True. Everyone has their own idiosyncrasies. Homogeneizing society is not cool. Leads to Cultural Revolutions. I'm happy RSS is pro decriminalization.
9/6/18, 9:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But everyone should know that public obscenity is still a crime. 


üòÇ
9/6/18, 9:56 PM - Aniket Awasthi: So no sword fighting in public
9/6/18, 9:59 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Haha üòÇüòÇ

9/7/18, 5:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: Yeah
9/7/18, 5:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: Good interviewer

9/7/18, 5:12 PM - Aniket Awasthi: BTW; Mercedes launched a high end electric car now
9/7/18, 5:12 PM - Arpit Saxena: Makes it entertaining but also asks hard questions usually
9/7/18, 5:13 PM - Arpit Saxena: It's 2.5 hours so not a quick interview
9/7/18, 5:13 PM - Kartik Vermun: Damn
9/7/18, 5:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: watch it in 2x

9/10/18, 4:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India ko jab Pata hai ki they are dependent on oil. Tab bhi why aren't they changing their habits?
9/10/18, 4:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Indians are fools
9/10/18, 4:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Japan has hedged themselves against oil with their investment in public transport and trains
9/10/18, 4:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They developed nuclear power too. But after fukuyama issue they had to rely on gas. 

Gas is a much more competitive market than oil
9/10/18, 4:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Indians are wannabe amreekans. 

Amreeka can pull of oil geo politics due to their financial sector and huge military. They have the diplomatic and military capabilities to ensure oil supply.

India par Agar blockade lagega to India ke paas tanks move karne ka bhi oil nahi hoga
9/10/18, 4:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: We have been crying about oil since 2 decades now. And we have done nothing
9/10/18, 4:33 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is a quintessential example of foolishness
9/10/18, 4:35 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What are we lacking ?
9/10/18, 4:35 PM - Arpit Saxena: That was a fiery rant
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Political willpower?
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Basic economics
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey I had used this phrase before
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Kartik Vermun: Aniket super pissed it seems
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why aren't their trains?
9/10/18, 4:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Why aren't there metros
9/10/18, 4:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Wait I'll share a data plot
9/10/18, 4:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm pretty sure Aniket business and political leaders are aware of what to do but are incapable
9/10/18, 4:38 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *unable
9/10/18, 4:39 PM - Arpit Saxena: I can't image what Delhi would be like without metro. So much of Delhi's productivity depends on it
9/10/18, 4:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan. Delhi is the only successful metro
9/10/18, 4:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't think so. 

Gadkari just announced huge 7 lakh crore plan to build roads.
9/10/18, 4:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Idk why aren't they investing in freight corridors?
9/10/18, 4:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: 12 saal se ban raha hai. Abhi tak nahi bana
9/10/18, 4:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Is this a hand drawn one
9/10/18, 4:42 PM - Kartik Vermun: Lol
9/10/18, 4:51 PM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
9/10/18, 4:52 PM - Aniket Awasthi: USA uses more trains than India
9/10/18, 4:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: When we know that oil is the vulnerability. Doing nothing about it is foolish.
9/10/18, 4:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Middle class has no other option but to buy cars. There's no real public transport available
9/10/18, 4:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What is the useful information in this
9/10/18, 4:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Where is this said
9/10/18, 5:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Economic survey
9/10/18, 5:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: And USA is a quintessential car country.
9/10/18, 5:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They use cars for passenger transportation
9/10/18, 5:04 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This is just about freight
9/10/18, 5:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Uber invited Tokyo governor Koike as a keynote speaker at their flying taxis summit. Instead she is talking about rail networks and renovating bridges. Send help üò¥üò¥ https://t.co/ZJSROW6LUO
9/10/18, 7:20 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Because heavy trucks are the future. Advancements in the stability of concrete highways and large trucks have outweighed those in railways. Freight in railways continues to slower, more prone to spillage and late deliveries.
9/10/18, 8:01 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's true for developed countries but not India
9/10/18, 8:09 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Roads have become better. The sizes of trucks transferring loads are ginormous. Dad had remarked this to me while dwelling on reduced demand for freight via railways due to preference for trucks.
9/10/18, 8:11 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's true for commodities. 

Is it true for heavy goods too? India me we are transporting cement, sand etc from trucks too
9/10/18, 8:17 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Yeah, I guess the revenues from commodities are higher than heavy goods.
9/10/18, 8:23 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Does India have viable energy alternatives? I remember reading long time back that none of solar, wind, hydro etc are consistent year-round( monsoons, no wind ) to be economically feasible
9/10/18, 8:24 PM - Aniket Awasthi: India has decreasing plf

10/19/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Cuz girls age faster anyways
10/19/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: 10 years is gn
10/19/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In which case I think he 'truly loves' her
10/19/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ?????
10/19/18, 6:13 PM - Kartik Vermun: Can't imagine Arpit doing celeb gossip
10/19/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: He just did
10/19/18, 6:13 PM - Kartik Vermun: I know
10/19/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't mind!
10/19/18, 6:13 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Let's bitch about those elite fucks
10/19/18, 6:14 PM - Rohan Bhamre: When I see symphony X barely getting 100000 on YouTube on their best songs
10/19/18, 6:14 PM - Kartik Vermun: That guy, khal drogo in got married someone way older
10/19/18, 6:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And then these so ccalled 'talented artists ' like lil Wayne get billion views on God knows what
10/19/18, 6:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Really grinds my gears
10/19/18, 6:17 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I recently started to understand hip hop. Stuff like Eminem, jayz. It's an interesting little world based on word play and bars
10/19/18, 6:24 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Would you say this is a symptom of cultural Marxism
10/19/18, 6:27 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It started out like that I guess primarily African American. But now is the most capitalistic in the music industry. Way more than rock
10/19/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Revenue structure is sure
10/19/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We are talking a out the music though
10/19/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The demand
10/19/18, 6:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The common man's taste
10/19/18, 6:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Blacks played and listened to jazz
10/19/18, 6:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Because they tried to be like whites
10/19/18, 6:31 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Depends on the artists. Lil pump Gucci gang for example is just a guy high on cocaine. More like being gangsta is cool. You could say that's anti corporate
10/19/18, 6:32 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: It's like numetal. It sounds cool and catchy so more popular
10/19/18, 6:33 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Artists like Eminem though have pretty serious talent. You could analyze his wordplay for days
10/19/18, 6:36 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Talent is there
10/19/18, 6:36 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Also I don't think music elitism is good. I feel any sort of elitism  means that we haven't really figured something out
10/19/18, 6:37 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Elitism is always bad
10/19/18, 6:38 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Most dt fans are like that for example
10/19/18, 6:39 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Anyways I think I'm missing the point now
10/19/18, 6:41 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: There has to be some neuro science behind why more people prefer pop music
10/19/18, 6:41 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Would be interesting to learn
10/19/18, 6:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: There's a nuance you did not acknowledge
10/19/18, 6:44 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Which one?
10/19/18, 6:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Would you say all tastes in music are equal
10/19/18, 6:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Too ambiguous
10/19/18, 6:45 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sorry I'll phrase it better next time we meet hopefully
10/19/18, 6:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not at all. The more you practice listening to music, the more refined the ear
10/19/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Exactly so disparity in taste is eventual
10/19/18, 6:46 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I would argue casual listeners have poorer tastes
10/19/18, 6:46 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So yes elites would exist
10/19/18, 6:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The bad thing would be elites to behave arrogantly with others
10/19/18, 6:47 PM - Rohan Bhamre: But not to acknowledge their superior tastes is denial
10/19/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Elitism is natural course of society
10/19/18, 6:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: The term I was advocating was meritocracy
10/19/18, 6:48 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think its one of those things pointless to be elite at
10/19/18, 6:48 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Not elitism
10/19/18, 6:48 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Arrogance is not welcome
10/19/18, 6:49 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yes I would say cultural Marxism has damaged meritocracy in music
10/19/18, 6:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Where merit is musical talent
10/19/18, 6:50 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And not brand
10/19/18, 6:50 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Ultimately the point of music is the value or entertainment derived from it. Does having better taste equate to deriving more pleasure? I would argue no so it's pointless to have better taste
10/19/18, 6:51 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Can't disagree
10/19/18, 6:51 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: What pleases the brain is biological
10/19/18, 6:52 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Taste is an imagined cultivated thing. Biology trumps that
10/19/18, 6:53 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I've a different take here. I feel that society should follow what is called "high culture". High culture comes through perfection, dedication and hardwork. 

Pop music involves no such traits hence is detestable.
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I think it has trickling down effects
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Nvm
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Regarding pleasure, any music will become pleasurable if you hear it again and again
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Well pop music does take hard work and what not
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Rohan Bhamre: In a way
10/19/18, 6:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That's how pop culture works
10/19/18, 6:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: "Jk" right?
10/19/18, 6:55 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hip feels
10/19/18, 6:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Composition distribution advertising ü§£
10/19/18, 6:55 PM - Rohan Bhamre: *mixing
10/19/18, 6:58 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Yes I agree. Pop music is definitely trivial.
10/19/18, 6:58 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Don't you think this undermines creativity
10/19/18, 6:59 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Sets a bad precedent
10/19/18, 6:59 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Im not so sure about that. Dissonant will always sound bad
10/19/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey, there's good proof. Have ever found yourself lipsing with that korean guy song
10/19/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Gangnam style
10/19/18, 7:00 PM - Rohan Bhamre: That song was a hit because of advertising of epic proportions
10/19/18, 7:00 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Not really. I think it's harder to make music good sound than it is to have mechanical skills like playing fast
10/19/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Beatles is ez as fuck
10/19/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Yet they are creative
10/19/18, 7:01 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm not talking about 'harder to create' music
10/19/18, 7:01 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I meant dissonant in a musical interval sense
10/19/18, 7:02 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: Gangnam style is not dissonant
10/19/18, 7:02 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: And the human ear specially likes repetitive beats
10/19/18, 7:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Point is absolutely tasteless tracks can be lodged in your brain
10/19/18, 7:02 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And familiarity will eventually make you like it
10/19/18, 7:04 PM - Ambikesh Mishra: I think it's the other way round. Your brain always likes that repetitive beat but your taste subconsciously tries to convince it that it sucks
10/19/18, 7:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey @917891947877
10/19/18, 7:04 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Having a blast ?
10/19/18, 7:36 PM - Arpit Saxena: Wow Maine kya chhed diya

10/19/18, 8:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You are scared to say nigga in this group
10/19/18, 8:34 PM - Apoorv Umang: Ofc

10/20/18, 12:42 PM - Apoorv Umang: Also I don't play fortnite

10/20/18, 2:38 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's like a massiah now
10/20/18, 2:38 PM - Arpit Saxena: How does he have time for memes
10/20/18, 2:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's a billionaire. He hires people to work for him. So he will have free time
10/20/18, 2:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: He's CEO of 3 companies
10/20/18, 2:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: If he was chairman/investor it would make sense
10/20/18, 2:40 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There's a conspiracy theory that Elon musk is catering to his fan base. Californian geeks and nerds
10/20/18, 2:40 PM - Arpit Saxena: Of course he is
10/20/18, 2:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: But understanding memes takes times u need to keep up
10/20/18, 2:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: He's not creating a product but he's creating a cult
10/20/18, 2:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Or they become stale
10/20/18, 2:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: True
10/20/18, 2:48 PM - Arpit Saxena: <Media omitted>
10/20/18, 2:54 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Bohot free hai yaar ye
10/20/18, 5:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Has anyone seen explicit video of Amritsar accident?

10/20/18, 5:56 PM - Arpit Saxena: Isn't that sub quarantined
10/20/18, 5:56 PM - Arpit Saxena: I can't view it
10/20/18, 5:57 PM - Apoorv Umang: I'm able to view it
10/20/18, 5:57 PM - Arpit Saxena: On RIF?
10/20/18, 6:02 PM - Apoorv Umang: No
10/20/18, 6:02 PM - Apoorv Umang: Website

10/23/18, 8:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's relative poverty
10/23/18, 8:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That matters
10/23/18, 8:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I'm on a train to Mumbai
10/23/18, 8:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bolo kuch
10/23/18, 8:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can read about psychology of revolution
10/23/18, 8:29 PM - Arpit Saxena: Sup
10/23/18, 8:30 PM - Arpit Saxena: Been in bus for almso 3 hours now
10/23/18, 8:30 PM - Arpit Saxena: Finally getting home
10/23/18, 8:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I was going through it recently. 

So apparently, it's not about absolute inequality but relative inequality that causes distress in the society.
10/23/18, 8:31 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Hey I may be wrong but isn't it known
10/23/18, 8:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Further it's not even about possession of wealth but display of wealth that incite revolutions and distress
10/23/18, 8:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Popular belief is that poverty buds distress. But most distressed people are the lower middle class in any society
10/23/18, 8:32 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Cuz we know that although poor people are getting richer, the rich are getting richer faster, which is a problem for peasants
10/23/18, 8:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aur bata eb.
10/23/18, 8:34 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Koi ladki kuch
10/23/18, 8:34 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Better topic

10/23/18, 8:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Ok

10/23/18, 9:26 PM - Arpit Saxena: And not much road travel
10/23/18, 9:51 PM - Apoorv Umang: Itni lambi trip kaise hogi, tum sabko chhutti mil jayegi?

12/10/18, 7:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Both are true for shubhayans case
12/10/18, 7:39 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Matlab both are the objective?

12/10/18, 7:59 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/10/18, 8:00 PM - Aniket Awasthi: They don't strive for happiness really from work
12/10/18, 8:04 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's pretty different from European or American societies, where the trend is that your life outside of work is what defines you.

12/16/18, 8:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I'll suggest
12/17/18, 8:28 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Did anyone follow the Google congressional hearing?
12/17/18, 8:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Do you think Google is biased?
12/17/18, 8:29 PM - Kartik Vermun: Sundar pichai
12/17/18, 8:29 PM - Kartik Vermun: He made a pretty good defense from the bits which I saw
12/17/18, 8:41 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I don't think so.
12/17/18, 8:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I didn't find his answers satisfactory. It wasn't detailed on many parts
12/17/18, 8:42 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For example. He had no defense on Google showing personalized search
12/17/18, 8:43 PM - Aniket Awasthi: It's true that their algorithm can't be manipulated by any human. But he didn't answer if the algorithms are unbiased by design
12/17/18, 8:44 PM - Aniket Awasthi: There was a part on external audit but again Google hired those companies
12/17/18, 9:06 PM - Kartik Vermun: Companies hiring other companies for audit is pretty common
12/17/18, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes
12/17/18, 9:07 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Did you try duckduckgo?
12/17/18, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: Yes
12/17/18, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: I've tried it as well
12/17/18, 9:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Views?
12/17/18, 9:08 PM - Kartik Vermun: Prefer Google search over it
12/17/18, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Apparently ddg also uses Google and yahoo
12/17/18, 9:09 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I prefer ddg in case of any controversial case. Or regarding news
12/18/18, 9:21 AM - Rohan Bhamre: <Media omitted>
12/18/18, 9:23 AM - Rohan Bhamre: As far as anti conservative bias, why aren't they calling YouTube patreon etc who are actually suppressing conservative voices
12/18/18, 9:28 AM - Rohan Bhamre: And please I am not talking about idiots like alex johns
12/18/18, 9:30 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Isn't YouTube owned by Google?
12/18/18, 9:32 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Alphabet is the parent company of Google and YouTube
12/18/18, 9:37 AM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: It's a Google subsidiary.

12/18/18, 10:39 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
12/18/18, 10:40 AM - Aniket Awasthi: <Media omitted>
12/18/18, 10:40 AM - Aniket Awasthi: @917407650530 @917891947877 

Need your inputs. You know more about this
12/18/18, 10:44 AM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't they did what you think they did in Google.
12/18/18, 10:44 AM - Rohan Bhamre: *I don't think they did
12/18/18, 11:18 AM - Apoorv Umang: at its core, if something is reference in a popular site it carries more weightage that its mention on unpopular sites
12/18/18, 11:18 AM - Apoorv Umang: so sometimes if people highly upvote and image on reddit with certain keywords it shows in google image search
12/18/18, 11:19 AM - Apoorv Umang: than its mention*
12/18/18, 11:19 AM - Apoorv Umang: an image*
12/18/18, 11:19 AM - Kartik Vermun: You are explaining page rank
12/18/18, 11:19 AM - Apoorv Umang: yes
12/18/18, 11:35 AM - Rohan Bhamre: In that case was YouTube discussed
12/18/18, 11:43 AM - Apoorv Umang: perhaps googles indexing is faster and it gives importance to recent stuff
12/18/18, 11:50 AM - Arpit Saxena: It's still very irrelevant results
12/18/18, 11:51 AM - Rohan Bhamre: Perception vs accuracy
12/18/18, 12:08 PM - Apoorv Umang: @917407650530 why hasnt google fixed it tho, maybe it doesn't consider it wrong?
12/18/18, 12:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Irrelevant results should be fixed
12/18/18, 12:32 PM - Arpit Saxena: Knowledge cards are curated, this kid be of search term should be considered in that category only I think
12/18/18, 12:32 PM - Arpit Saxena: Kind of#
12/18/18, 12:33 PM - Apoorv Umang: explain please. which search term should be considered in what category
12/18/18, 12:34 PM - Arpit Saxena: Search for fool in Google search
12/18/18, 12:34 PM - Arpit Saxena: It shows knowledge card
12/18/18, 12:34 PM - Arpit Saxena: But not for idiot
12/18/18, 12:34 PM - Arpit Saxena: They already have an algorithm to find such terms
12/18/18, 12:34 PM - Apoorv Umang: idiot shows too
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Arpit Saxena: Oh yeah
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Arpit Saxena: Hmm
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Haan
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Aniket Awasthi: I just searched
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Arpit Saxena: I think idiot is highlighted just because of recent news
12/18/18, 12:35 PM - Arpit Saxena: Thode din mein wapas theek ho jauega
12/18/18, 12:36 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Google has too much weight on current main stream media I think
12/18/18, 12:36 PM - Apoorv Umang: another reason is because pple try to exploit google's algorithm, like 4chan
12/18/18, 12:37 PM - Apoorv Umang: they can explout others too but they dont have incentive
12/18/18, 12:37 PM - Apoorv Umang: like ddg
12/18/18, 12:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Point
12/18/18, 12:37 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But shouldn't Google be beware of it and make results robust
12/18/18, 9:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Arey some months ago Google had absolutely ridiculous results for some searches
12/18/18, 9:40 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like American family, white mom, American scientists
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Etc
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't exactly remember
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: American scientists k tha
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Rohan Bhamre: @917407650530 ?
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Arpit Saxena: Likely its was biased because of similar term African American scietlntist
12/18/18, 9:41 PM - Kartik Vermun: You were searching white moms?
12/18/18, 9:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lul
12/18/18, 9:42 PM - Arpit Saxena: Which is a more common search term
12/18/18, 9:42 PM - Rohan Bhamre: No I read an article which claimed this. And then I went ahead and searched and it was actually ridiculous
12/18/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: American scientists were all black ü§£
12/18/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like 95%
12/18/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Other searches I don't remember
12/18/18, 9:43 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Probably white mother showing only interracial couples
12/18/18, 9:44 PM - Arpit Saxena: The first scientist is still black
12/18/18, 9:44 PM - Arpit Saxena: Xd

12/18/18, 9:50 PM - Aniket Awasthi: If one has a cake. Doesn't mean that he won't like a gulab jamun

12/21/18, 6:01 PM - Arpit Saxena: https://www.gofundme.com/TheTrumpWall
12/21/18, 6:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Still better than tipping mediocre female dota gamer on twitch
12/21/18, 6:02 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But 11 million is noice
12/21/18, 6:02 PM - Arpit Saxena: 11mil in 4 days wtf
12/21/18, 6:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Wow so many racists!
12/21/18, 6:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: People earn $1000 around in an hour long stream
12/21/18, 6:03 PM - Kartik Vermun: People actually funding this üò≥
12/21/18, 6:03 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And nazis
12/21/18, 6:03 PM - Aniket Awasthi: @14043680303 @18144419636 Aap bhi Daan de do
12/21/18, 6:06 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: The Chinese were pretty damn racist too
12/21/18, 6:06 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Guess we just found a metric to reliably measure racism
12/21/18, 6:07 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Guess so
12/21/18, 6:08 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Btw. Anyone believes in eugenics around here?
12/21/18, 6:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: What's there to believe
12/21/18, 6:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: Didn't know if watch twitch
12/21/18, 6:09 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Like it's good or bad waisa kya
12/21/18, 6:09 PM - Arpit Saxena: You*
12/21/18, 6:10 PM - Aniket Awasthi: That some traits are better than other traits
12/21/18, 6:10 PM - Rohan Bhamre: You don't need to watch twitch to get information
12/21/18, 6:11 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Isnt it obvious
12/21/18, 6:11 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Natural mutations allow for critical advancement of species
12/21/18, 6:12 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Natural mutations for advancement is really to just increase survivability fitness value
12/21/18, 6:13 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Actually eugenics is a wrong concept. 

A trait can be good or bad depending on the environment. Like taller humans are considered better today but midgets will be better if we have to live in a cave
12/21/18, 6:13 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Aye
12/21/18, 6:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: We're not going back to the cave anytime soon
12/21/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not you. But your specie might have to
12/21/18, 6:16 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You never know
12/21/18, 6:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Anytime soon
12/21/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: For a specie a few thousand years is a very small amount of time
12/21/18, 6:17 PM - Aniket Awasthi: You can't predict the next 50 years let alone next 500 years
12/21/18, 6:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Ofcourse, fitness value really depends on the environment
12/21/18, 6:18 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Much of human development for 'survival of fittest' is sociological and technological
12/21/18, 6:19 PM - Apoorv Umang: Jamaicans can run fast because of genes
12/21/18, 6:19 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Our innovations have outpaced natural selection
12/21/18, 6:20 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: True. However most human survival no longer relies on running fast
12/21/18, 6:20 PM - Apoorv Umang: Is eugenics about mental differences between races or physical too?
12/21/18, 6:21 PM - Apoorv Umang: Yeah technological advances are too fast for natural selection to have an effect
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Advances in medicine
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Faulty genes are more successful in carrying over
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Than otherwise
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Rohan Bhamre: ?
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Apoorv Umang: But artificial selection fat
12/21/18, 6:22 PM - Apoorv Umang: Fast
12/21/18, 6:23 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. Iq is also genetic
12/21/18, 6:24 PM - Shubhayan Ghoshal: Going to go all scientific and cite Wikipedia:

"a major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether "negative" or "positive" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of genetic diversity, resulting in inbreeding depression due to lower genetic variation."
12/21/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: This happened in dogs. Especially "pure breed" dogs
12/21/18, 6:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Who the fuck likes pugs
12/21/18, 6:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Fucking disgusting rats
12/21/18, 6:25 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Abominations
12/21/18, 6:25 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Like great Danes die of heart attack. Bulldogs can't breathe properly
12/21/18, 6:26 PM - Rohan Bhamre: German shepherd master race
12/21/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Only viable dogs in caves
12/21/18, 6:26 PM - Aniket Awasthi: üòÜ
12/21/18, 6:27 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Bhai tu reh cave me
12/21/18, 6:27 PM - Aniket Awasthi: All we need is a jihadi Pakistani to start a nuclear war. Nuclear winter
12/21/18, 6:28 PM - Apoorv Umang: Like we have completely changed plants and animals in around 1000 years through artificial selection
12/21/18, 6:28 PM - Apoorv Umang: So breeding smart people we might create smarter people? Isn't that possible?
12/21/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Do we have the tech to do that in a robust manner
12/21/18, 6:29 PM - Rohan Bhamre: To avoid this
12/21/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Yes. It is possible. But it creates other issues due to many recessive genes expressing themselves. 

Like they might be very smart but mighty suffer from a very weak cardio vascular system
12/21/18, 6:29 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Not at the moment. Solving this genetic problem is a np-hard problem as of now
12/21/18, 6:30 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Lagao GAü§£
12/21/18, 6:30 PM - Aniket Awasthi: People are working in that direction though
12/21/18, 6:31 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Like this Chinese guy recently designed a genetically engineered baby. He cut out the HIV gene using crispr
12/21/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: But this isn't a robust method as we don't have any information about the other side effects of such gene editing.
12/21/18, 6:32 PM - Aniket Awasthi: Hence a np hard problem
12/21/18, 6:39 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Aporv aa Raha hai kya tu
12/21/18, 6:45 PM - Apoorv Umang: No
12/21/18, 6:45 PM - Apoorv Umang: Other plans

12/21/18, 7:15 PM - Apoorv Umang: Why /s isn't that a fact? Jews have higher iq?
12/21/18, 7:15 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Anything controversial
12/21/18, 7:16 PM - Apoorv Umang: Sorry my metro ride just ended ttyl
12/21/18, 7:16 PM - Rohan Bhamre: My outstation ride gonna last a while

12/21/18, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: Baat chedne k liye I said that phrase
12/21/18, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I don't actually believe that
12/21/18, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: I noticed a lot of people think that
12/21/18, 7:18 PM - Arpit Saxena: How tf you build roads
12/21/18, 7:18 PM - Rohan Bhamre: So wanted some discussion
12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Arpit Saxena: Apparently India has low tax rate even among 3rd world countries
12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Arpit Saxena: 17% GDP or something
12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Rohan Bhamre: And even less tax efficiency
12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Aniket Awasthi: No. Tax rate is high. Tax to Gdp is low
12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Arpit Saxena: China is 22

12/21/18, 7:20 PM - Arpit Saxena: Collection I mean
