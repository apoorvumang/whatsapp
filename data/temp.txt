[10/06 18:17] Anshu Mali Saxena: I feel that both should move into IT sales jobs to start enjoying a more challenging way of working and living. I say this from my over 17 years of experience in transforming software engineering techies into happy sales professionals.
[10/06 18:19] Anshu Mali Saxena: And going for higher education in the same techies line will not help. Nor a techie startup without experiencing the challenges of corporate sales as it will help both of them to explore their people talent and technology knowledge better.
[10/06 18:22] Anshu Mali Saxena: I have a friend who heads recruitment in a large IT Company Merino India at Moti Nagar (near your house)  I could try and place them both in sales there. Thereafter they could grow in sales and self confidence
17/06/2017, 10:42 pm - Mummy: *Does It Make Sense?*

Three friends had an accident in a car and became unconscious. A stranger got to the scene and wanted to call for help. He had no phone. *There were six mobile phones in the accident car but all had password on them*. 
They all died as a result....!

A pregnant lady collapsed at home with her little daughter. The little girl had no idea of what was happening but saw her mother gasping for air. *She picked her mother's phone to call her Daddy but there was a password on the phone*. 
She lost her life.....!

Whose fault? 

*My advice is this.*
You are too precious than the information you are securing on your phone.

Only put password on your WhatsApp, Text messages, Facebook, files, etc and leave the call side free. You may one day save your life or the life of your loved ones.  

*The password on your phone can be your death warrant.*

Think twice.

A message worth spreading.....creating awareness is real HUMANITY than sympathising or emphathising on the situation....

30/06/2017, 10:06 pm - Ice: You may have heard the statement “Sitting is the New Smoking!”
 
When I first heard this saying, I thought it was crazy. 
 
Sitting is NOT like smoking.
 
But recently, I looked more into it, and it completely changed my outlook on one aspect of health that most people neglect.
 
Here's the problem: we sit an average of 9 to 10 hours a day. So we sit more than we sleep. We sit more than we stand or do any activity. 
 
We sit in our cars. We sit to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We sit to work. We sit to watch TV. We sit at the movie theater. We sit at the dentist’s office. We sit everywhere. 
 
What’s the problem with so much sitting?
 
You’ll be surprised to hear that it’s not really “back pain” or any such thing (although, that can happen too!). 
 
The problem with so much sitting is that our bodies were not meant for it. 
 
For millions of year, we were in constant movement for 10-12 hours a day. 
 
Switch that to sitting for 10 hours, and there’s no amount of exercise you can do that can undo the damage. 
 
Even if, after your day at the office, you went to the gym for two hours, it wouldn’t negate the damage done by sitting. 
 
That’s what led Dr. James Levine to coin the phrase “Sitting is the New Smoking!” 
 
When you stand, your body works very differently than when you sit. 
 
Sitting for hours a day causes the following damage ...

Because blood flow slows down, you increase your risk of heart disease.

Your insulin is negatively affected by just one day of sitting 10 hours a day.

Sitting increases your risk of cancer, for reasons we’re still speculating about. 

Perhaps it’s the antioxidant processes that are engaged when we are in movement.

Sitting compresses your body, slowing down digesting, leading to cramps, heartburn, constipation and bloating. 

Brain function slows down when we sit. 

Your brain gets less blood and oxygen.

Because of the above, mood worsens. 

Posture gets worse, leading to strained neck and shoulders. 
Your entire body degenerates when you sit 10 hours a day. 

Standing requires tensing of the abdominal muscles. 

Sitting leads to weak abs, leading to mobility issues.

Varicose veins develop.

Your bones get weaker.

One study found that you can increase your lifespan by two years by sitting down three hours or less a day. 

Another study found that each hour spent watching TV after 25 reduces your life expectancy by 22 minutes.
 
On the other hand, each cigarette reduces your life expectancy by 11 minutes.
 
Hence… sitting is the new smoking!

19/07/2017, 9:03 pm - Mummy: *SAFE - DRIVING TIPS* ............ 

*WHEN IT IS RAINING* !!!

*GOOD VISION IN A DOWNPOUR.*

*1.* How to achieve good vision while driving during a heavy downpour. We are not sure why it is so effective; Just try this method when it rains heavily. This method was told by a Police friend who had experienced and confirmed it.

It is useful...even driving at night.

Most of the motorists would turn wind sheild wipers on 'HIGH' or on the  'FASTEST SPEED' during heavy downpour, yet the visibility in front of the windshield is still bad..
In the event you face such a situation, just put on your 'SUNGLASSES'  and miracles!

All of a sudden, your visibility in front of your windshield is perfectly clear, as if there is no rain.

Make sure you always have a pair of SUNGLASSES in your car. You are not only helping yourself to drive safely with good vision, but also might save your friend's life by giving him this idea.Try it yourself and share it with your friends...!!!Amazingly, you'll still see the drops on the windshield, but not the sheet of rain falling.You'll also see where the rain bounces off the road. Wearing sunglasses works to eliminate the "blindness" from passing cars. Or the "kickup" if you are following a car in the rain. They ought to teach this little tip in driver's training. It really does work. This is a good warning.

I wonder how many people knew about this??? 
*2.*
Another good tip:
A 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago. It was raining,though not excessively when her car suddenly began to hydro-plane and literally flew through the air. She was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence!

When she explained to the PoliceOfficer what had happened, he told her something that every driver should know - 
NEVER - EVER 'DRIVE' IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON.'
She however, thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the Police Officer told her that if the cruise control is on, your car will in fact begin to hydro-plane. When the tires lose contact with the road,your car will automatically accelerate to a higher rate of speed, making you take off like an aeroplane.

She told the Officer that was exactly what had occurred.

The Officer said; 'This warning should be listed, on the driver's seat sun-visor -

'NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE ROAD IS WET OR ICY'

Along with the airbag warning. 'We tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed - but; 'We don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the road is dry.

The only person the accident victim found who knew this, (besides the Officer), was a man who'd had a similar accident, totalled his car and sustained severe injuries.

NOTE:

Some vehicles (like the Toyota Sienna Limited XLE) will not allow you to set the cruise control when your windshield wipers are on.

Even if you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about it, it's still worth it.'You may have saved a life.'

02/10/2017, 3:16 pm - Papa: हैं अपने एक फूफाजी, बहुत जो़र मसालेदार।
तबियत खुश कर देते है, जो बातों से हर बार।

थी बचपन में कटर-शार्पनर, की हमको दरकार।
बोले फूफाजी बच्चों तुम, घबराओ न बेकार।

लोहे का एक कटर, तुम्हें हम देंगे शानदार।
रूड़की-नहर के शेर करेंगे, यह ऑर्डर तैयार।

हम बच्चे थे, तुरत मान गये उनकी ये मनुहार।
करने लगे फिर उत्सुकता से, कटर का इंतज़ार।

दिन बीते, हफ़्ते बीते, बीते कई माह और साल।
कटर हमारा spl था, अभी हो रहा था तैयार।

बचपन बीता,यौवन आया,हम बड़े हुए सरकार।
पर कटर हमारा spl था, जारी था जहाँ सुधार।

तभी अचानक आया इक,पार्सल अपने द्वार।
खोला तो पाया अंदर था,एक शेर-कटर खूंखार।

नस-नस अपनी झूम गई, बज उठे दिल के तार।
धन्य हुए पाकर आखिर, कटर का ये पुरस्कार।

क्या रमणीक था वो,उज्जवल-सा लिए निखार।
उमंग-तरंग रह गए दोनों, ठगे-से उसे निहार।

बहुत शुक्रिया आपके, जो प्रेम की पड़ी फुहार।
आज उसी का replica, फूफ्स, करें स्वीकार।

16/02/2018, 2:42 pm - Ice: “ I am rich, fit, and I have mastered almost everything I wanted to master. Why am I still not happy and still not satisfied?” - posted in Quora by Anonymous

*Answer by Karim Elsheikh*: 

“Human happiness (as we know it) is caused by 4 basic chemicals:

*Dopamine*
*Endorphins*
*Serotonin*
*Oxytocin*

# On your journey to become fit, your body released endorphins to cope with the pain of physical exercise. You probably began to enjoy exercise as you got into it, and the endorphins made you happy - *temporarily*.

# On your journey to become rich, you probably completed many tasks and goals. You probably bought all the things you’ve ever wanted. Nice cars, beautiful clothes, and a perfect home. This released dopamine in your brain when you achieved your goals and bought these things, which once again contributed to your happiness - *temporarily*.

*So what about the other two chemicals?*

It turns out that human happiness is incomplete without all 4 chemicals constantly being released in the brain.

So now you need to work on releasing serotonin and oxytocin.

“How do I do that, Buddy?”

# Serotonin is released when we act in a way that benefits others. When we give to causes beyond ourselves and our own benefit. When we connect with people on a deep, human level. Writing this Quora answer is releasing serotonin in my brain right now because I’m using my precious time on the weekend to give back to others for free. Hopefully I’m providing useful information that can help other people, like yourself.

*That’s why you often see billionaires turning to charity when they have already bought everything they wanted to, and experienced everything they wanted to in life*. They’ve had enough dopamine from material pleasures, now they need the serotonin.

# Oxytocin on the other hand, is released when we become close to another human being. *When we hug a friend, or shake someone’s hand, oxytocin is released in varying amounts*.

Oxytocin is easy to release. It’s all about becoming more social!

Share your wealth with your friends and family to create amazing experiences.

Laugh, love, cooperate, and play with others.
That’s it my friend!

I think it all comes down to the likelihood that you are missing two things: contribution and social connection”

*Keep Smiling*😊🙏🏼

BSNL and Airtel network is available up to Kafnu. Please finish all your important telephone calls in Kafnu and inform anxious family members about *poor connectivity* on the trail and that *you can only call them after 22nd July*. Tell them in case of emergency (minimum chance), I will call them. If I don't call, it means the trek is going well.

Network is available next at Kaza – you will drive through Kaza on your way from Mudh to Manali. After Kaza, there is no network till you cross Rohtang Pass.

07/11/2018, 10:15 pm - Ice: दीप जलाऊँ :-

----------------------------
हर  दिशा  में तम गहराया। 
इतने  दीप  कहाँ  से लाऊँ। j
           जहाँ  अँधेरा सबसे ज्यादा। 
           उन कोनों  में दीप  जलाऊँ। 

एक  भावना  के  आँगन  में। 
एक साधना के आसन पर। 
          एक   उपासना  के  मंदिर में। 
          एक  सत्य के  सिंहासन  पर। 
बनूँ  मैं  माटी  किसी दीप की। 
और   कभी   बाती  बन  जाऊँ।
        जहाँ   अँधेरा   सबसे  ज्यादा।  
        उन  कोनों  में   दीप  जलाऊँ।

एक  दिल   के  तहखाने   में भी। 
स्वप्निल तारों  की  छत पर भी। 
        एक  प्यार   की  पगडण्डी पर। 
        खुले  विचारों  के मत  पर  भी। 
जलूँ   रात  भर  बिना  बुझे  मैं। 
तेल बनूँ तिल तिल जल जाऊँ।  
            जहाँ  अँधेरा सबसे ज्यादा। 
            उन कोनों  में दीप  जलाऊँ।

एक   दोस्ती  की  बैठक  में। 
एक ईमान की  राहों पर भी। 
         एक मन की खिड़की के ऊपर। 
         एक  हंसी  के चौराहों पर भी। 
दीप की लौ है सहमी-सहमी। 
तुफानों    से    इसे    बचाऊँ। 
         जहाँ   अँधेरा   सबसे  ज्यादा।  
         उन   कोनों  में  दीप  जलाऊँ। 

बचपन  के गलियों में भी एक। 
और यादों  के पिछवाड़े में भी। 
        अनुभव  की  तिजोरी पर एक। 
        और    उम्र    के    बाडे  में भी। 
बाती    की  अपनी  सीमा  है। 
कैसे    इसकी    उम्र   बढ़ाऊँ। 
         जहाँ   अँधेरा   सबसे  ज्यादा।  
         उन   कोनों  में  दीप  जलाऊँ। 

हार   है   निश्चित  अंधेरों   की। 
जग   में    एेसी   आस  जगाऊँ।  
        सुबह का सूरज जब तक आये। 
        मैं   प्रकाश  प्रहरी   बन   जाँऊ। 
हर  दिशा  में तम गहराया। 
इतने  दीप  कहाँ  से लाऊँ। 
         जहाँ   अँधेरा   सबसे  ज्यादा।  
         उन  कोनों   में  दीप v जलाऊँ।

        ______*शुभ दीपोत्सव*

05/12/2018, 7:49 pm - Ice: Hilarious take on how 'budget airlines Indigo' charge, and what happens when it is given back to them !!!! 
Spare a thought for poor Rahul Bhatia, Chief Executive of Indigo.
After arriving in a hotel in Mumbai, he went to the bar and asked for a pint of Guinness. 
The barman nodded and said, "That will be ₹50 please, Mr. Bhatia." 
Somewhat taken aback, Rahul replied, "That's very cheap," and handed over his money.
"Well, we do try to stay ahead of the competition", said the barman. "And we are serving free pints every Wednesday from 6pm until 8pm. We have the cheapest beer in Mumbai".
"That is remarkable value", Rahul comments.
"I see you don't seem to have a glass, so you'll probably need one of ours. That will be ₹150 please." 
Rahul scowled, but paid up. 
He took his drink and walked towards a seat. "Ah, you want to sit down?" said the barman. "That'll be an extra ₹150. You could have pre-booked the seat, and it would have only cost you ₹100."
"I think you may to be too big for the seat sir, can I ask you to sit in this frame please". 
Rahul attempts to sit down but the frame is too small and when he can't squeeze in he complains "Nobody would fit in that little frame". 
"I'm afraid if you can't fit in the frame you'll have to pay an extra surcharge of ₹250 for your seat sir". 
Rahul swore to himself, but paid up.
"I see that you have brought your laptop with you" added the barman. "And since that wasn't pre-booked either, that will be another ₹300." 
Rahul was so incensed that he walked back to the bar, slammed his drink on the counter, and yelled, "This is ridiculous, I want to speak to the manager". 
"I see you want to use the counter," says the barman, "that will be ₹200 please." 
Rahul's face was red with rage. "Do you know who I am?" 
"Of course I do Mr. Bhatia." 
"I've had enough! What sort of Hotel is this? I come in for a quiet drink and you treat me like this. I insist on speaking to a manager!"
"Here is his E-mail address, or if you wish, you can contact him between 9.00am and 9.01am every morning, Monday to Tuesday at this free phone number. Calls are free, until they are answered, then there is a talking charge of only ₹10 per second, or part thereof".
"I will never use this bar again".
"OK sir, but remember, we are the only star hotel in Mumbai selling pints for ₹50.

08/01/2019, 8:28 pm - Ice: On my way home today from Navi Mumbai to Malad  at around 8:15 pm, as soon as I took a right turn from WEH going towards Malad Station, a policeman signalled me to stop. 

As I stopped, he asked me to open the trunk of the car. I opened the trunk from inside and was about to step down, but the policeman said,  “Ok Ok u may go.”  

I started my car and started driving, but something struck my mind, as from my rear view mirror, I saw one of the policemen immediately on his phone.

I went a bit ahead took the service rd and finding a good street-light stopped my car on the side. Switching off the engine I went and opened my car-trunk physically.

*Guess what !!!* 😳 ... I was shocked to see two small zip-lock pouches with white crystals inside.  It was numbed on the pouch ... but just decided to throw it away and *thanked God* 🙏  for saving me from such rascals who would have caught me in a drug related case ..  *trying to extort a huge amount from me*  in order to stop the case. 

The policemen must have informed their Bhai standing at the next check-point to get hold of so and so car number. 

I was correct in my guess.  Approx half a mile later,  I was stopped by another policeman. This time too I was asked to open my trunk. 

Now I got down, took my car-keys in hand,  went behind and opened the dicki physically. I'm sure they must have been puzzled and surprised that they did not find anything.

*Please don’t open your car trunk from inside, for anyone, even at Malls. Always get-off,  take yur car-keys in hand  and open the trunk with keys and permit searching under your own supervision.*

Kindly share this as much as u can, to save people. Happened with a resident in *Malad (west) Link Road ..*                   ...                                                                                      Fowarded as received
